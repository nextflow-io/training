# Advanced Workflow Development

This collection provides a comprehensive training experience covering advanced Nextflow workflow development concepts. It combines four essential topics that are frequently used together in real-world workflow development scenarios.

Let's get started! Click on the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button below to launch the training environment (preferably in a separate tab), then read on while it loads.

## Learning objectives

In this collection, you will learn advanced concepts for building robust and scalable workflows.

By the end of this collection you will be able to:

- Design and implement complex workflow architectures using workflows of workflows
- Write comprehensive tests for your workflows using nf-test
- Effectively manage sample-specific metadata throughout your workflows
- Implement advanced data splitting and grouping strategies

## Audience & prerequisites

This collection is designed for users who have completed the basic Nextflow training and want to dive deeper into advanced workflow patterns, testing strategies, and data management techniques.

**Prerequisites**

- Completion of [Hello Nextflow](../../../hello_nextflow/) training or equivalent experience
- Basic familiarity with Nextflow syntax and concepts
- Experience with command-line tools
- Understanding of basic workflow development patterns

## Collection contents

This collection consists of four modules that cover complementary advanced topics:

1. **[Workflows of Workflows](../../../side_quests/workflows_of_workflows.md)** - Complex workflow architecture and composition
2. **[Testing with nf-test](../../../side_quests/nf-test.md)** - Testing strategies for Nextflow workflows
3. **[Sample-specific Data Management](../../../side_quests/metadata.md)** - Handling sample-specific data throughout workflows
4. **[Splitting and Grouping](../../../side_quests/splitting_and_grouping.md)** - Advanced data processing patterns

Each module is self-contained and covers independent concepts, but we recommend completing them in the order listed above for a logical progression through the topics during training sessions.

## How to use this collection

This collection provides a curated learning path through existing training materials. To work through this collection:

1. **Start with the first module link above** - Begin with Workflows of Workflows
2. **Complete each module** - Follow the training content in the recommended order
3. **Return to this page** - Use it as a navigation hub to find the next module
4. **Take the [survey](./survey.md)** - Provide feedback when you complete the collection

This approach allows you to follow a structured learning path while accessing the detailed training materials.

## What you'll build

By the end of this collection, you'll have experience with:

- **Complex workflow architectures** - Combining multiple workflows into cohesive pipelines
- **Comprehensive testing strategies** - Ensuring your workflows are reliable and maintainable
- **Metadata management** - Handling sample-specific data throughout your workflows
- **Advanced data processing** - Implementing efficient splitting and grouping patterns

These skills will enable you to build robust, scalable, and maintainable Nextflow workflows for real-world applications.
