# Training Collections

This section contains curated collections of training modules called [Side Quests](../side_quests/index.md) that aim to provide a comprehensive learning experience around a particular theme or use case.

## Prerequisites

Each collection has specific prerequisites documented on its index page. However, most collections assume:

- Experience with the command line
- Foundational Nextflow concepts and tooling covered in the [Hello Nextflow](../../hello_nextflow/) beginner training course

For technical requirements and environment setup, see the [Environment Setup](../../envsetup/) mini-course.

## Available collections

- [The Architect's Toolkit I](./architects_toolkit_1.md) - A collection of four Side Quests covering workflow architecture patterns for assembling complex pipelines, implementing testing strategies, managing metadata management, and grouping and splitting data. _Estimated duration: 4 hours in group training._

## Suggesting new collections

We are actively working on developing additional Side Quests and Collections.
Please feel free to suggest topics that you think would make sense to cover in a Collection by posting in the [Training section](https://community.seqera.io/c/training/) of the community forum.
