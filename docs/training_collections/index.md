# Training Collections

This section contains curated collections of training content that are frequently used together for specific events or customer needs. Each collection is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience around a particular theme or use case.

Let's get started! Click on the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button below to launch the training environment (preferably in a separate tab), then read on while it loads.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/nextflow-io/training?quickstart=1&ref=master)

## Prerequisites

Each collection has specific prerequisites documented in its index page. However, most collections assume:

- Experience with the command line
- Foundational Nextflow concepts and tooling covered in the [Hello Nextflow](../../hello_nextflow/) beginner training course
- Familiarity with basic workflow development concepts

For technical requirements and environment setup, see the [Environment Setup](../../envsetup/) mini-course.

## Available Collections

- [Advanced Workflow Development](./advanced_workflow_development/index.md) - A comprehensive 4-hour collection covering advanced workflow patterns, testing, and data management

## Creating Custom Collections

If you need a custom collection for your specific use case, please contact us through the [Training section](https://community.seqera.io/c/training/) of the community forum.
