# Introduction

Nextflow provides a powerful way to develop pipelines. However, it does not provide standards for how pipelines should be developed. This gap has led to the establishment of pipeline registries, such as [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/), with tools and implementation guidelines that provide support and standards for pipeline development.

nf-core developed a base template to enable standardization and the adoption of good coding practices. The template establishes a pipeline file structure, with code, documentation, and continuous integration (CI) tests. The template plugs into the nf-core tooling, offering a full suite of commands that support pipeline usage and development.

Leveraging the nf-core template enables accelerated maintenance and development of pipelines.

## Learning objectives

In In Part 1 of this workshop, you will utilize the nf-core tooling to build a small pipeline using the nf-core template.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

-   Discuss the benefits of using the nf-core pipeline template
-   Identify the features of nf-core pipeline template that enable best practices
-   Add nf-core modules to a pipeline using the nf-core tooling
-   Add parameters to a pipeline and update the schema using the nf-core tooling

In Part 2 of this workshop, you will use the nf-core tooling to continue development of your pipeline and customize parts of the nf-core template.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

-   Add local modules
-   Patch nf-core modules
-   Customize linting tests
-   Sync TEMPLATE
-   Bump versions
