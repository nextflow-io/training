# Part 4: Hello Channels

In Part 3, you built a pipeline that was completely linear and processed each sample's data independently of the others.
However, in real pipelines, you may need to combine data from multiple samples, or combine different kinds of data.
Here we show you how to use channels and channel operators to implement a pipeline with more interesting plumbing.

Specifically, we show you how to implement joint variant calling with GATK, building on the pipeline from Part 2.

!!! note

    Don't worry if you're not familiar with GATK or genomics in general. We'll summarize the necessary concepts as we go, and the workflow implementation principles we demonstrate here apply broadly to any use case that follows a similar pattern.

### Method overview

The GATK variant calling method we used in Part 3 simply generated variant calls per sample.
That's fine if you only want to look at the variants from each sample in isolation, but that only yields limited information.
It's often more interesting to look at variant calls differ across multiple samples, and to do so, GATK offers an alternative method called joint variant calling, which we demonstrate here.

Joint variant calling involves generating a special kind of variant output called GVCF (for Genomic VCF) for each sample, then combining the GVCF data from all the samples and finally, running a 'joint genotyping' statistical analysis.

![Joint analysis](img/joint-calling.png)

What's special about a sample's GVCF is that it contains records summarizing sequence data statistics about all positions in the targeted area of the genome, not just the positions where the program found evidence of variation.
This is critical for the joint genotyping calculation ([further reading](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890431-The-logic-of-joint-calling-for-germline-short-variants)).

The GVCF is produced by GATK HaplotypeCaller, the same tool we used in Part 2, with an additional parameter (`-ERC GVCF`).
Combining the GVCFs is done with GATK GenomicsDBImport, which combines the per-sample calls into a data store (analogous to a database), then the actual 'joint genotyping' analysis is done with GATK GenotypeGVCFs.

So to recap, we're going to develop a workflow that does the following:

<figure class="excalidraw">
--8<-- "docs/hello_nextflow/img/hello-gatk-2.svg"
</figure>

1. Generate an index file for each BAM input file using Samtools
2. Run the GATK HaplotypeCaller on each BAM input file to generate a GVCF of per-sample genomic variant calls
3. Collect all the GVCFs and combine them into a GenomicsDB data store
4. Run joint genotyping on the combined GVCF data store to produce a cohort-level VCF

### Dataset

-   **A reference genome** consisting of a small region of the human chromosome 20 (from hg19/b37) and its accessory files (index and sequence dictionary).
-   **Three whole genome sequencing samples** corresponding to a family trio (mother, father and son), which have been subset to a small portion on chromosome 20 to keep the file sizes small.
    The sequencing data is in [BAM](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) (Binary Alignment Map) format, i.e. genome sequencing reads that have already been mapped to the reference genome.
-   **A list of genomic intervals**, i.e. coordinates on the genome where our samples have data suitable for calling variants, provided in BED format.

---

## 0. Warmup: Run Samtools and GATK directly

Just like previously, we want to try out the commands manually before we attempt to wrap them in a workflow.

!!! note

     Make sure you're in the correct working directory:
     `cd /workspace/gitpod/hello-nextflow`

### 0.1. Index a BAM input file with Samtools

This first step is the same as in Part 2: Hello-GATK, so you can skip it if you've already done that in this session.

#### 0.1.1. Pull the samtools container

```bash
docker pull community.wave.seqera.io/library/samtools:1.20--b5dfbd93de237464
```

#### 0.1.2. Spin up the container interactively

```bash
docker run -it -v ./data:/data community.wave.seqera.io/library/samtools:1.20--b5dfbd93de237464
```

#### 0.1.3. Run the indexing command

```bash
samtools index /data/bam/reads_mother.bam
```

#### 0.1.4. Check that the BAM index has been produced

```bash
ls /data/bam/
```

This should show:

```console title="Output"
reads_father.bam      reads_mother.bam      reads_mother.bam.bai  reads_son.bam
```

Where `reads_mother.bam.bai` has been created as an index to `reads_mother.bam`.

#### 0.1.5. Exit the container

```bash
exit
```

### 0.2. Call variants with GATK HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode

This second step is **different** from Part 2: Hello-GATK, since now we are running GATK in 'GVCF mode', so you **should NOT skip it**.

#### 0.2.1. Pull the GATK container

```bash
docker pull community.wave.seqera.io/library/gatk4:4.5.0.0--730ee8817e436867
```

#### 0.2.2. Spin up the container interactively

```bash
docker run -it -v ./data:/data community.wave.seqera.io/library/gatk4:4.5.0.0--730ee8817e436867
```

#### 0.2.3. Run the variant calling command with the GVCF option

Most of this command is the same as in Part 2, except this time we add the `-ERC GVCF` option, which switches on the HaplotypeCaller's GVCF mode to produce genomic VCFs.

```bash
gatk HaplotypeCaller \
        -R /data/ref/ref.fasta \
        -I /data/bam/reads_mother.bam \
        -O reads_mother.g.vcf \
        -L /data/ref/intervals.bed \
        -ERC GVCF
```

_TODO: point out output_
_POINT OUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT COMPARED TO THE VCF IN PART 2_

#### 0.2.4. Repeat the process on the other two samples

```bash
gatk HaplotypeCaller \
        -R /data/ref/ref.fasta \
        -I /data/bam/reads_father.bam \
        -O reads_father.g.vcf \
        -L /data/ref/intervals.bed \
        -ERC GVCF
```

```bash
gatk HaplotypeCaller \
        -R /data/ref/ref.fasta \
        -I /data/bam/reads_son.bam \
        -O reads_son.g.vcf \
        -L /data/ref/intervals.bed \
        -ERC GVCF
```

Once this completes, you should have three files ending in `.g.vcf` in your work directory; one per sample.

### 0.3. Run joint genotyping

This is a new command that looks at the data in all the GVCFs for each genomic position and recalculates variant statistics and individual genotypes in light of the data available across all samples in the cohort.

#### 0.3.1. Combine all the per-sample GVCFs

```bash
gatk GenomicsDBImport \
    -V /data/bam/reads_mother.vcf \
    -V /data/bam/reads_father.vcf \
    -V /data/bam/reads_son.vcf \
    --genomicsdb-workspace-path family_trio_gdb
```

_TODO: point out output_

#### 0.3.2. Run the joint genotyping analysis proper

```bash
gatk GenotypeGVCFs \
    -R /data/ref/ref.fasta \
    -V gendb://family_trio_gdb \
    -O family_trio.vcf
```

_TODO: point out output_

#### 0.3.3. Exit the container

```bash
exit
```

### Takeaway

You know how to run the individual commands in the terminal.

### What's next?

Wrap these commands into an actual pipeline.

---

## 1. Modify the per-sample variant calling step to produce a GVCF

We'll start from `hello-channels.nf`, which is a copy of the workflow that results from Part 2 of this training series.
However, that pipeline produces VCF files, whereas now we want GVCF files in order to do the joint genotyping, so we need to switch on the GVCF variant calling mode and update the output file extension.

### 1.1. Tell HaplotypeCaller to emit a GVCF and update the output file path

Add the `-ERC GVCF` parameter to the GATK HaplotypeCaller command and update the output file path to use the corresponding `.g.vcf` extension, as per GATK convention.

_Before:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
    """
    gatk HaplotypeCaller \
        -R ${ref_fasta} \
        -I ${input_bam} \
        -O ${input_bam}.vcf \
        -L ${interval_list}
    """
```

_After:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
    """
    gatk HaplotypeCaller \
        -R ${ref_fasta} \
        -I ${input_bam} \
        -O ${input_bam}.g.vcf \
        -L ${interval_list} \
        -ERC GVCF
    """
```

### 1.2. Run the pipeline to verify that you can generate GVCFs

```bash
nextflow run hello-channels.nf
```

Should produce something like:

_TODO: COPY OUTPUT_

```console title="Output"

```

If you open the file and scroll through it, you can see that GATK HaplotypeCaller produced a GVCF file, which contains additional information compared to the VCF file.

### Takeaway

Okay, this one was minimal in terms of Nextflow learning...
But hey, now you know the difference between a regular VCF and a Genomic VCF!

### What's next?

Learn to collect the contents of a channel and pass them in as a single input.

---

## 2. Collect and combine the GVCF data across all samples

We now need to collect all the GVCF files together and bundle them together as a single input to the next process, to feed into GATK GenomicsDBImport.

###

### 2.1. Write a process called GATK_GENOMICSDB

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
/*
 * Combine GVCFs into GenomicsDB datastore
 */
process GATK_GENOMICSDB {

    container "community.wave.seqera.io/library/gatk4:4.5.0.0--730ee8817e436867"

    publishDir 'results', mode: 'copy'

    input:
        path gvcfs
        path idxs
        val cohort_name

    output:
        path "${cohort_name}_gdb"

    """
    gatk GenomicsDBImport \
        -V ${gvcfs} \
        --genomicsdb-workspace-path ${cohort_name}_gdb
    """
}
```

### 2.2. Add default value for the cohort name parameter up top

We need to provide an arbitrary name for the cohort.
Later in the series you'll learn how to use the available metadata for this, but for now we just declare a CLI parameter using `params` and give it a default value for convenience.

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
// Base name for final output file
params.cohort_name = "family_trio"
```

### 2.3. Gather the outputs of GATK_HAPLOTYPECALLER across samples using `collect()`

We collect the VCFs and their index files (`.idx`) separately in order to list only the VCFs in the command we're going to construct.
Since we'll give all of those files together to the joint genotyping process, we don't have to worry about the order of files like we did in Part 2.

Add this to the `workflow` body, right after the call to GATK_HAPLOTYPECALLER:

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
// Collect variant calling outputs across samples
all_gvcfs = GATK_HAPLOTYPECALLER.out[0].collect()
all_idxs = GATK_HAPLOTYPECALLER.out[1].collect()
```

!!! tip

    You can view the contents of the channel after performing this collect operation using `.view()`

### 2.4. Add a call to the workflow block to run GATK_GENOMICSDB

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
// Combine GVCFs into a GenomicsDB datastore
GATK_GENOMICSDB(
    all_gvcfs,
    all_idxs,
    params.cohort_name
)
```

### 2.5. Run the workflow

```bash
nextflow run hello-channels.nf -resume
```

Oh no! The pipeline produces an error. When we dig into the console output, we can see the command executed isn't correct:

```bash
Command executed:

  gatk GenomicsDBImport -V reads_mother.bam.g.vcf reads_father.bam.g.vcf reads_son.bam.g.vcf --genomicsdb-workspace-path family_trio_gdb
```

Can you spot the error? We gave `gatk GenomicsDBImport` multiple VCF files for a single `-V` argument, but the tool expects a separate `-V` argument for each GVCF file.

As a reminder, this was the command we ran in the container:

```bash
gatk GenomicsDBImport \
    -V /data/bam/reads_mother.vcf \
    -V /data/bam/reads_father.vcf \
    -V /data/bam/reads_son.vcf \
    --genomicsdb-workspace-path family_trio_gdb
```

### 2.6. Construct a command line with a separate `-V` argument for each input GVCF

We add the reserved keyword `script:` to declare the start of the script section explicitly, and we use some string manipulations to construct the `${gvcfs_line}`:

_Before:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
    """
    gatk GenomicsDBImport \
        -V ${gvcfs} \
        --genomicsdb-workspace-path ${cohort_name}_gdb
    """
```

_After:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
    script:
    def gvcfs_line = gvcfs.collect { "-V ${it}" }.join(' ')
    """
    gatk GenomicsDBImport \
        ${gvcfs_line} \
        --genomicsdb-workspace-path ${cohort_name}_gdb
    """
```

In this new code, `gvcfs.collect { "-V ${it}" }.join(' ')` takes each GVCF path (referenced by `${it}`), adds the `-V ` prefix then joins the resulting strings into a single string formatted correctly for the GenomicsDBImport tool.

### 2.7. Run the workflow to verify that it generates the GenomicsDB output as expected

```bash
nextflow run hello-channels.nf -resume
```

Now we see the additional process show up in the log output (showing the compact view):

_TODO: Update console output_

_TODO: check the output_

### Takeaway

Now you know how to collect outputs from a channel and bundle them as a single input to another process.
You also know how to construct a command line to provide the file names to the tool with the appropriate syntax.

### What's next?

Add a second command to the same process.

---

## 3. Run the joint genotyping step as part of the same process

Now that we have the combined genomic variant calls, we can run the joint genotyping tool, which will produce the final output that we actually care about: the VCF of cohort-level variant calls.

### 3.1. Rename the process from GATK_GENOMICSDB to GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING

Since the process will be running more than one tool, we change its name to refer to the overall operation rather than a single tool name.

_Before:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
/*
 * Combine GVCFs into GenomicsDB datastore
 */
process GATK_GENOMICSDB {
```

_After:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
/*
 * Combine GVCFs into GenomicsDB datastore and run joint genotyping to produce cohort-level calls
 */
process GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING {
```

### 3.2. Add the joint genotyping command to the GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING process

Simply add the second command after the first one inside the script section.

_Before:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
    """
    gatk GenomicsDBImport \
        -V ${gvcfs} \
        --genomicsdb-workspace-path ${cohort_name}_gdb
    """
```

_After:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
    """
    gatk GenomicsDBImport \
        ${gvcfs_line} \
        --genomicsdb-workspace-path ${cohort_name}_gdb

    gatk GenotypeGVCFs \
        -R ${ref_fasta} \
        -V gendb://${cohort_name}_gdb \
        -O ${cohort_name}.joint.vcf
    """
```

### 3.3. Add the reference genome files to the GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING process input definitions

The second command requires the reference genome files, so we need to add those to the process inputs.

_Before:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
input:
    path gvcfs
    path idxs
    val cohort_name
```

_After:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
input:
    path gvcfs
    path idxs
    val cohort_name
    path ref_fasta
    path ref_index
    path ref_dict
```

### 3.4. Update the process output definition to emit the VCF of cohort-level variant calls

We don't really care to save the GenomicsDB datastore; the output we're actually interested in is the VCF produced by the joint genotyping command.

_Before:_

````groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
output:
    path "${cohort_name}_gdb"
_After:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
output:
    path "${cohort_name}.joint.vcf"
    path "${cohort_name}.joint.vcf.idx"
````

### 3.5. Update the process call from GATK_GENOMICSDB to GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING

Let's rename the process call from GATK_GENOMICSDB to GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING.

And while we're at it, let's add the reference genome files as inputs, since we need to provide them to the joint genotyping tool.

_Before:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
// Combine GVCFs into a GenomicsDB datastore
GATK_GENOMICSDB(
    all_gvcfs,
    all_idxs,
    params.cohort_name
)
```

_After:_

```groovy title="hello-channels.nf"
// Combine GVCFs into a GenomicsDB datastore and apply joint genotyping
GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING(
    all_gvcfs,
    all_idxs,
    params.cohort_name,
    ref_file,
    ref_index_file,
    ref_dict_file
)
```

### 3.6. Run the workflow

Finally, we can run the modified workflow!

```bash
nextflow run hello-channels.nf -resume
```

The output should look like this:

```console title="Output"
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 24.02.0-edge
Launching `hello-channels.nf` [nauseous_thompson] DSL2 - revision: b346a53aae
executor >  local (7)
[d1/43979a] process > SAMTOOLS_INDEX (2)       [100%] 3 of 3 ✔
[20/247592] process > GATK_HAPLOTYPECALLER (3) [100%] 3 of 3 ✔
[14/7145b6] process > GATK_JOINTGENOTYPING (1)      [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
```

You can find the final output file, `family_trio.joint.vcf`, in the work directory for the last process.
Click on it to open it and you'll see 40 lines of metadata header followed by just under 30 jointly genotyped variant records (meaning at least one of the family members has a variant genotype at each genomic position listed).

!!! tip

    Keep in mind the data files covered only a tiny portion of chromosome 20; the real size of a variant callset would be counted in millions of variants. That's why we use only tiny subsets of data for training purposes!

### Takeaway

You know how to modify how channel contents are grouped using the collect() operator, in order to generate a cohort-level VCF of variant calls.

### What's next?

Celebrate your success and take an extra long break! This was tough and you deserve it.

In the next training, you'll learn how to manage metadata and use a more sophisticated samplesheet for passing inputs.

**Good luck!**
