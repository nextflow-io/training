# Part 9: Hello Seqera

So far we've been running Nextflow workflows on our local machine using the command line interface.
In this section, we'll introduce you to Seqera Platform, a powerful cloud-based platform for running, monitoring, and sharing Nextflow workflows.

!!! tip

    [Sign up](https://cloud.seqera.io/) to try Seqera for free or request a [demo](https://seqera.io/demo/) for deployments in your own on-premise or cloud environment.

You'll learn how to use Seqera Platform within Nextflow CLI, the Seqera Platform GUI, and the API.

You can use Seqera Platform via either the **CLI**, through the **online GUI** or through the **API**.
