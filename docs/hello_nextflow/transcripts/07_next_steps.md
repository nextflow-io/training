## Welcome

Congratulations, you've done it. You've completed the first Nextflow training course, called Hello Nextflow

well done. Thank you for sticking through it and we really appreciate the time and effort that you've put into learning Nextflow, and we really hope that it'll be useful for your work.

## Next Steps

For next steps, keep an eye out on the training portal: training.nextflow.io. We're putting new course material up there all the time and refreshing it as well. So you might be able to find more advanced training, or training which is specific to a field of research that you're interested in.

Specifically, check out the Nextflow for Science page. This has a series of short courses which are standalone, and they extend what you've learned in Hello Nextflow to specific use cases.

There's one for Genomics and also one for RNA-seq. We hope to bring more soon.

## Side Quests

There are a lot of things that we could have talked about in Hello Nextflow, which would've been too much detail. Some of these things we're putting into Side Quests, which are short courses on specific topics.

There's also the larger fundamentals training and advanced training courses, which may include content that you find interesting.

## nf-core

It's been mentioned once or twice in this course, but definitely check out the nf-core project. There are over a hundred pipelines there for different types of data, so it's entirely possible that you may not need to build your own pipeline.

There are also nearly one and a half thousand process modules where if you use the nf-core developer tooling, you can create a pipeline and import those modules in a matter of seconds.

## Seqera Platform

Lastly, a quick plug for Seqera Platform. This is without doubt the best way to run Nextflow in practice, it's a cloud-based platform, but you attach your own compute infrastructure, be it your own cloud account on AWS, Google Batch, or Azure, or even your own HPC. The free tier is available to everyone , and if you're an academic, you can apply to our academic program for free, pro-level access.

Seqera Platform goes beyond just a graphical interface for launching and monitoring workflows. There's also additional tooling such as Data Studios for running interactive sessions, and fundamental tooling such as Fusion, which gives faster and cheaper access to data over the cloud.

## Support and events

Remember, if you ever hit any trouble, just go to community.seqera.io. Our forum there is really active, the Nextflow community is super strong and there's nearly always people on hand ready to help out, be it for training or any thing to do with your day-to-day usage of Nextflow.

And of course, a great next step is to join one of our community events, whether that's an nf-core hackathon or one of the Nextflow Summit events. They're great fun, and it'd be really nice to meet you there and chat about what you're using Nextflow for.

## Thank yous

I'd like to give a huge thank you to everyone who's been involved in writing this training material. I've been presenting it, but really all the hard work has been done by the training team at Seqera. Specifically Geraldine, who's put a huge amount of work into rewriting this material.

Also, Marcel, Ken, Adam, John, others from the scientific development team and others in the community.

## Feedback survey

Now that you've finished the course, we'd love to know what you thought of it. On training.nextflow.io, you'll find a feedback survey underneath the Hello Nextflow section.

There's only four questions but it's really important for us. If nothing else, it tells us roughly how many people are doing the training. It also tells us whether you liked it and if you have any suggestions, please drop them in at the end. We read every single submission.

If you spot any errors everything is open source on GitHub, so you can create an issue or make a pull request or drop us message in the forum. We'd love to hear what you thought of it and how we could improve it. Thanks again. Hope to see you soon.
