nf-core is a community effort to develop and maintain a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.

nf-core provides a standardized set of best practices, guidelines, and templates for building and sharing scientific pipelines.
These pipelines are designed to be modular, scalable, and portable, allowing researchers to easily adapt and execute them using their own data and compute resources.

One of the key benefits of nf-core is that it promotes open development, testing, and peer review, ensuring that the pipelines are robust, well-documented, and validated against real-world datasets.
This helps to increase the reliability and reproducibility of scientific analyses and ultimately enables researchers to accelerate their scientific discoveries.
