# Hello Nextflow

**Hello Nextflow is a hands-on introduction to building reproducible and scalable data analysis workflows.**

Working through practical examples and guided exercises, you will learn the fundamentals of developing with Nextflow, including how to define processes, connect them into pipelines, manage files and software dependencies, parallelize execution effortlessly, and run workflows across different computing environments.

You will take away the skills and confidence to start developing and running your own workflows with Nextflow.

<!-- additional_information -->

## Course overview

The entire course is designed to be hands-on, with goal-oriented exercises structured to introduce information gradually.

You will develop a simple Nextflow pipeline that takes some text inputs, runs a few transformation steps, and outputs a single text file containing an ASCII picture of a character saying the transformed text.

### Lesson plan

In order to avoid overwhelming you with concepts and code, we've broken this down into six parts that will each focus on specific aspects of developing pipelines with Nextflow.

| Course chapter                                       | Summary                                                                                          | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| [Part 1: Hello World](./01_hello_world.md)           | Basic components and principles involved in assembling and running a Nextflow workflow           | 30 mins            |
| [Part 2: Hello Channels](./02_hello_channels.md)     | Using channels and operators for processing inputs and parallelizing execution effortlessly      | 45 mins            |
| [Part 3: Hello Workflow](./03_hello_workflow.md)     | Using channels to chain multiple steps together and handle transfer of data between steps        | 60 mins            |
| [Part 4: Hello Modules](./04_hello_modules.md)       | Applying code modularity principles to increase reusability and decrease maintenance burden      | 20 mins            |
| [Part 5: Hello Containers](./05_hello_containers.md) | Using containers as a mechanism for managing software dependencies and increase reproducibility  | 60 mins            |
| [Part 6: Hello Config](./06_hello_config.md)         | Customizing pipeline behavior and optimizing usage in different computational environments usage | 60 mins            |

By the end of this course, you will be well-prepared for tackling the next steps in your journey to develop and apply reproducible workflows for your scientific computing needs.
