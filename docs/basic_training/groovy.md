# Groovy basic structures and idioms

Nextflow is a domain specific language (DSL) implemented on top of the Groovy programming language, which in turn is a super-set of the Java programming language. This means that Nextflow can run any Groovy or Java code.

Here are some important Groovy syntax that are commonly used in Nextflow.

## Printing values

To print something is as easy as using one of the `print` or `println` methods.

```groovy linenums="1"
println("Hello, World!")
```

The only difference between the two is that the `println` method implicitly appends a new line character to the printed string.

!!! tip

    Parentheses for function invocations are optional. Therefore, the following syntax is also valid:

    ```groovy linenums="1"
    println "Hello, World!"
    ```

## Comments

Comments use the same syntax as C-family programming languages:

```groovy linenums="1"
// comment a single line

/*
    a comment spanning
    multiple lines
*/
```

## Variables

To define a variable, simply assign a value to it:

```groovy linenums="1"
x = 1
println x

x = new java.util.Date()
println x

x = -3.1499392
println x

x = false
println x

x = "Hi"
println x
```

Local variables are defined using the `def` keyword:

```groovy linenums="1"
def x = 'foo'
```

The `def` should be always used when defining variables local to a function or a closure.

## Lists

A List object can be defined by placing the list items in square brackets:

```groovy linenums="1"
list = [10,20,30,40]
```

You can access a given item in the list with square-bracket notation (indexes start at `0`) or using the `get` method:

```groovy linenums="1"
println list[0]
println list.get(0)
```

In order to get the length of a list you can use the `size` method:

```groovy linenums="1"
println list.size()
```

We use the `assert` keyword to test if a condition is true (similar to an `if` function). Here, Groovy will print nothing if it is correct, else it will raise an AssertionError message.

```groovy linenums="1"
assert list[0] == 10
```

!!! note

    This assertion should be correct, try changing it to an incorrect one.

Lists can also be indexed with negative indexes and reversed ranges.

```groovy linenums="1"
list = [0,1,2]
assert list[-1] == 2
assert list[-1..0] == list.reverse()
```

!!! info

    In the last assert line we are referencing the initial list and converting this with a "shorthand" range (`..`), to run from the -1th element (2) to the 0th element (0).

List objects implement all methods provided by the [java.util.List](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html) interface, plus the extension methods provided by [Groovy](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/util/List.html).

```groovy linenums="1"
assert [1,2,3] << 1 == [1,2,3,1]
assert [1,2,3] + [1] == [1,2,3,1]
assert [1,2,3,1] - [1] == [2,3]
assert [1,2,3] * 2 == [1,2,3,1,2,3]
assert [1,[2,3]].flatten() == [1,2,3]
assert [1,2,3].reverse() == [3,2,1]
assert [1,2,3].collect{ it+3 } == [4,5,6]
assert [1,2,3,1].unique().size() == 3
assert [1,2,3,1].count(1) == 2
assert [1,2,3,4].min() == 1
assert [1,2,3,4].max() == 4
assert [1,2,3,4].sum() == 10
assert [4,2,1,3].sort() == [1,2,3,4]
assert [4,2,1,3].find{it%2 == 0} == 4
assert [4,2,1,3].findAll{it%2 == 0} == [4,2]
```

## Maps

Maps are like lists that have an arbitrary key instead of an integer. Therefore, the syntax is very much aligned.

```groovy linenums="1"
map = [a:0, b:1, c:2]
```

Maps can be accessed in a conventional square-bracket syntax or as if the key was a property of the map.

!!! info ""

    Click the :material-plus-circle: icons in the code for explanations.

```groovy linenums="1"
assert map['a'] == 0 // (1)!
assert map.b == 1 // (2)!
assert map.get('c') == 2 // (3)!
```

1. Using square brackets.
2. Using dot notation.
3. Using the `get` method.

To add data or to modify a map, the syntax is similar to adding values to a list:

```groovy linenums="1"
map['a'] = 'x' // (1)!
map.b = 'y' // (2)!
map.put('c', 'z') // (3)!
assert map == [a:'x', b:'y', c:'z']
```

1. Using square brackets.
2. Using dot notation.
3. Using the put method.

Map objects implement all methods provided by the [java.util.Map](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) interface, plus the extension methods provided by [Groovy](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/util/Map.html).

## String interpolation

String literals can be defined by enclosing them with either _single-_ ('') or _double-_ ("") quotation marks.

```groovy linenums="1"
foxtype = 'quick'
foxcolor = ['b', 'r', 'o', 'w', 'n']
println "The $foxtype ${foxcolor.join()} fox"

x = 'Hello'
println '$x + $y'
```

```console title="Output"
The quick brown fox
$x + $y
```

!!! info

    Note the different use of `$` and `${..}` syntax to interpolate value expressions in a string literal.
    The `$x` variable was _not_ expanded, as it was enclosed by single quotes.

Finally, string literals can also be defined using the `/` character as a delimiter. They are known as **slashy** strings and are useful for defining regular expressions and patterns, as there is no need to escape backslashes. As with double-quote strings they allow to interpolate variables prefixed with a `$` character.

Try the following to see the difference:

```groovy linenums="1"
x = /tic\tac\toe/
y = 'tic\tac\toe'

println x
println y
```

```console title="Output"
tic\tac\toe
tic    ac    oe
```

## Multi-line strings

A block of text that spans multiple lines can be defined by delimiting it with triple single or double quotes:

```groovy linenums="1"
text = """
    Hello there James.
    How are you today?
    """
println text
```

Finally, multi-line strings can also be defined with slashy strings. For example:

```groovy linenums="1"
text = /
    This is a multi-line
    slashy string!
    It's cool, isn't it?!
    /
println text
```

!!! info

    Like before, multi-line strings inside double quotes and slash characters support variable interpolation, while single-quoted multi-line strings do not.

## If statement

The `if` statement uses the same syntax common in other programming languages, such as Java, C, JavaScript, etc.

```groovy linenums="1"
if( < boolean expression > ) {
    // true branch
}
else {
    // false branch
}
```

The `else` branch is optional. Also, the curly brackets are optional when the branch defines just a single statement.

```groovy linenums="1"
x = 1
if( x > 10 )
    println 'Hello'
```

!!! tip

    `null`, empty strings, and empty collections are evaluated to `false`.

    Therefore a statement like:

    ```groovy linenums="1"
    list = [1,2,3]
    if( list != null && list.size() > 0 ) {
        println list
    }
    else {
        println 'The list is empty'
    }
    ```

    Can be written as:

    ```groovy linenums="1"
    list = [1,2,3]
    if( list )
        println list
    else
        println 'The list is empty'
    ```

    See the [Groovy-Truth](http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html#Groovy-Truth) for further details.

!!! tip

    In some cases it can be useful to replace the `if` statement with a ternary expression (aka conditional expression). For example:

    ```groovy linenums="1"
    println list ? list : 'The list is empty'
    ```

    The previous statement can be further simplified using the [Elvis operator](http://groovy-lang.org/operators.html#_elvis_operator), as shown below:

    ```groovy linenums="1"
    println list ?: 'The list is empty'
    ```

## For statement

The classical `for` loop syntax is supported as shown here:

```groovy linenums="1"
for (int i = 0; i <3; i++) {
    println("Hello World $i")
}
```

Iteration over list objects is also possible using the syntax below:

```groovy linenums="1"
list = ['a','b','c']

for( String elem : list ) {
    println elem
}
```

## Functions

It is possible to define a custom function into a script, as shown here:

```groovy linenums="1"
int fib(int n) {
    return n < 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}

assert fib(10)==89
```

A function can take multiple arguments separating them with a comma. The `return` keyword can be omitted and the function implicitly returns the value of the last evaluated expression. Also, explicit types can be omitted, though not recommended:

```groovy linenums="1"
def fact( n ) {
    n > 1 ? n * fact(n-1) : 1
}

assert fact(5) == 120
```

## Closures

Closures are the Swiss army knife of Nextflow/Groovy programming. In a nutshell, a closure is a block of code that can be passed as an argument to a function. A closure can also be used to define an anonymous function.

More formally, a closure allows the definition of functions as first-class objects.

```groovy linenums="1"
square = { it * it }
```

The curly brackets around the expression `it * it` tells the script interpreter to treat this expression as code. The `it` identifier is an implicit variable that represents the value that is passed to the function when it is invoked.

Once compiled, the function object is assigned to the variable `square` as any other variable assignment shown previously. To invoke the closure execution use the special method `call` or just use the round parentheses to specify the closure parameter(s). For example:

```groovy linenums="1"
assert square.call(5) == 25
assert square(9) == 81
```

As is, this may not seem interesting, but we can now pass the `square` function as an argument to other functions or methods. Some built-in functions take a function like this as an argument. One example is the `collect` method on lists:

```groovy linenums="1"
x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ].collect(square)
println x
```

```console title="Output"
[ 1, 4, 9, 16 ]
```

By default, closures take a single parameter called `it`, to give it a different name use the `->` syntax. For example:

```groovy linenums="1"
square = { num -> num * num }
```

It’s also possible to define closures with multiple, custom-named parameters.

For example, when the method `each()` is applied to a map it can take a closure with two arguments, to which it passes the _key-value_ pair for each entry in the `map` object. For example:

```groovy linenums="1"
printMap = { a, b -> println "$a with value $b" }
values = [ "Yue" : "Wu", "Mark" : "Williams", "Sudha" : "Kumari" ]
values.each(printMap)
```

```console title="Output"
Yue with value Wu
Mark with value Williams
Sudha with value Kumari
```

A closure has two other important features.

First, it can access and _modify_ variables in the scope where it is defined.

Second, a closure can be defined in an _anonymous_ manner, meaning that it is not given a name, and is defined in the place where it needs to be used.

As an example showing both these features, see the following code fragment:

```groovy linenums="1"
result = 0 // (1)!
values = ["China": 1 , "India" : 2, "USA" : 3] // (2)!
values.keySet().each { result += values[it] } // (3)!
println result
```

1. Defines a global variable.
2. Defines a map object.
3. Invokes the `each` method passing the closure object which modifies the `result` variable.
