# Nextflow for [course-name]

This training course is intended for researchers in [main field] and related fields who are interested in developing or customizing data analysis pipelines.
It builds on the [Hello Nextflow](../../hello_nextflow/) beginner training and demonstrates how to use Nextflow in the specific context of [course-name] analysis.

Specifically, this course demonstrates how to implement a simple [course name or analysis] pipeline to [high-level summary].

Let's get started! Click on the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button below to launch the training environment (preferably in a separate tab), then read on while it loads.

## Learning objectives

By working through this course, you will learn how to apply foundational Nextflow concepts and tooling to a typical [course-name] use case.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

- Write a linear workflow to apply basic [course-name or applicable terms] methods
- Handle domain-specific files such as [examples] appropriately
- Handle [type of data] data
- Leverage Nextflow's dataflow paradigm to parallelize [analysis]
- [add as applicable] using relevant channel operators [and other features as applicable]

<!-- TODO
[optional advanced add-ons]
- Configure pipeline execution and manage resource allocations
- Handle metadata propagation
- Implement per-step and end-to-end pipeline tests that handle analysis-specific idiosyncrasies appropriately
-->

## Prerequisites

The course assumes some minimal familiarity with the following:

- Tools and file formats commonly used in this scientific domain
- Experience with the command line
- Foundational Nextflow concepts and tooling covered in the [Hello Nextflow](../../hello_nextflow/) beginner training.

For technical requirements and environment setup, see the [Environment Setup](../../envsetup/) mini-course.

<!-- TODO
For courses with the advanced add-ons, document the relevant prerequisites, eg:
- Part X assumes familiarity with [Side Quest](url) or [Collection](url)
-->
