# Nextflow for Science

These are courses that demonstrate how to apply the concepts and components presented in the [Hello Nextflow](../hello_nextflow/) beginner course to specific scientific use cases. Each course consists of a series of training modules that are designed to help learners build up their skills progressively.

!!! exercise "Nextflow for Genomics"

    !!! tip inline end ""

        :material-run-fast: Learn to develop a pipeline for genomics in Nextflow.

    This is a course for researchers who wish to learn how to develop their own genomics pipelines. The course uses a variant calling use case to demonstrate how to develop a simple but functional genomics pipeline.

!!! exercise "Nextflow for RNAseq"

    !!! tip inline end ""

        :material-run-fast: Learn to develop a pipeline for RNAseq data processing in Nextflow.

    This is a course for researchers who wish to learn how to develop their own RNAseq pipelines. The course uses a bulk RNAseq processing use case to demonstrate how to develop a simple but functional RNAseq pipeline.

!!! exercise "Nextflow for Bioimaging"

    !!! tip inline end ""

        :material-run-fast: Learn to run pipelines for imaging data in Nextflow.

    This is a course for researchers who wish to learn how to run and configure bioimaging pipelines. The course uses nf-core/molkart to demonstrate essential Nextflow usage patterns applicable to any pipeline.
