# Next Steps

Congrats again on completing the Small Nextflow workshop and thank you for completing our survey!

## 1. Top 3 ways to level up your Nextflow skills

Here are our top three recommendations for what to do next based on the workshop you just completed.

### 1.1. Master the fundamentals with Hello Nextflow

**[Hello Nextflow](../../hello_nextflow/index.md)** is a comprehensive hands-on course that provides deeper explanations of Nextflow concepts.

If the Small Nextflow workshop gave you a taste of what's possible and you want to understand the details more thoroughly, Hello Nextflow is the perfect next step.
It covers channels, processes, modules, containers, and configuration in greater depth with more exercises and examples.

### 1.2. Get started with nf-core

**[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/)** is a worldwide collaborative effort to develop standardized open-source pipelines for a wide range of scientific research applications.
The project includes [over 100 pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/) that are available for use out of the box and [well over 1400 process modules](https://nf-co.re/modules/) that can be integrated into your own projects, as well as a rich set of developer tools.

The **[Hello nf-core](../../hello_nf-core/index.md)** training course is a hands-on introduction to the nf-core project and its rich set of community-curated pipelines.
Part 1 covers how to find and use existing nf-core pipelines, which can save you a lot of time and effort.

The rest of the training covers how to adopt nf-core standards and conventions in your own work, work with nf-core modules, and contribute back to the project.

### 1.3. Explore advanced topics with Side Quests

If you're ready to dive deeper into specific Nextflow topics, check out our growing **collection of [Side Quests](../../side_quests/index.md)**.

These are short standalone courses that go deep into specific topics like:

- Metadata handling
- Working with files
- Splitting and grouping data
- Debugging workflows
- Testing with nf-test
- And more!

Each Side Quest focuses on a particular skill or pattern you can apply to your own workflows.

## 2. Apply Nextflow to your domain

**Check out the [Nextflow for Science](../../nf4_science/index.md) page** for a list of short standalone courses that demonstrate how to apply Nextflow concepts to common scientific analysis use cases:

- **Genomics**: Variant calling workflows
- **RNAseq**: Gene expression analysis
- **Imaging**: Image processing pipelines

These courses show you how to apply what you learned in Small Nextflow to real scientific problems in your field.

If you don't see your domain represented, let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) or by [creating an issue in the training repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/training/issues/new/choose) so we can add it to our to-do list.

## 3. Check out Seqera Platform

**[Seqera Platform](https://seqera.io/) is the best way to run Nextflow in practice.**

It is a cloud-based platform developed by the creators of Nextflow that you can connect to your own compute infrastructure (whether local, HPC or cloud) to make it much easier to launch and manage your workflows, as well as manage your data and run analyses interactively in a cloud environment.

The Free Tier is available for free use by everyone (with usage quotas).
Qualifying academics can get free Pro-level access (no usage limitations) through the [Academic Program](https://seqera.io/academic/program/).

Have a look at the [Seqera Platform tutorials](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/getting-started/quickstart-demo/comm-showcase) to see if this might be useful to you.

### That's it for now!

**Good luck in your Nextflow journey and don't hesitate to let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) what else we could do to help.**
