# Nextflow Training

Welcome to the Nextflow community training portal!

We have several distinct training courses available on this website. Scroll down to find the one that's right for you!

The training courses listed below are designed to be useable as a self-service resource; you can work through them on your own at any time (see Training Environment Setup for practical details). However, you may get even more out of them by joining a group training event.

-   Free online events are run regularly by the nf-core community, see the [nf-core events page](https://nf-co.re/events) for more.
-   Seqera (the company that develops Nextflow) runs a variety of training events, see the [Seqera Events](https://seqera.io/events/) page and look for 'Seqera Sessions' and 'Nextflow Summit'.
-   Our Community team also regularly teaches trainings hosted by third party organizations; announcements and signups for those are typically managed by the third-party hosts.
