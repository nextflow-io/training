## 1. Top 3 ways to level up your Nextflow skills

Here are our top three recommendations for what to do next based on the course you just completed.

### 1.1. Get involved with the nf-core community

**The nf-core community is a welcoming, collaborative space** where you can keep learning, connect with others, and make meaningful contributions. Join the [nf-core Slack workspace](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) to ask questions, share ideas, and stay updated. Whether you attend a hackathon, help improve a pipeline, or just chat with fellow community members, getting involved is a great way to grow your skills and be part of the future of open bioinformatics.

### 1.2. Apply Nextflow to a scientific analysis use case

**Check out the [Nextflow for Science](../nf4_science/index.md) page** for a list of short standalone courses that demonstrate how to apply the basic concepts and mechanisms presented in Hello Nextflow to common scientific analysis use cases.

If you don't see your domain represented by a relatable use case, let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) so we can add it to our development list.

### 1.3. Master more advanced Nextflow features

In the Hello courses, we keep the level of technical complexity low on purpose to avoid overloading you with information you don't need in order to get started with Nextflow.
As you move forward with your work, you're going to want to learn how to use the full feature set and power of Nextflow.

To that end, we are currently working on a **collection of [Side Quests](../side_quests/index.md)**, which are meant to be short standalone courses that go deep into specific topics like testing, metadata handling, using conditional statements and the differences between working on HPC _vs._ cloud.

For any topics that's not covered there yet, **browse the [Fundamentals Training](../basic_training/index.md) and [Advanced Training](../advanced/index.md)** to find training materials about the topics that interest you.

## 2. Check out Seqera Platform

**[Seqera Platform](https://seqera.io/) is the best way to run Nextflow in practice.**

It is a cloud-based platform developed by the creators of Nextflow that you can connect to your own compute infrastructure (whether local, HPC or cloud) to make it much easier to launch and manage your workflows, as well as manage your data and run analyses interactively in a cloud environment.

The Free Tier is available for free use by everyone (with usage quotas).
Qualifying academics can get free Pro-level access (no usage limitations) through the [Academic Program](https://seqera.typeform.com/to/SRB8Ci3n).

Have a look at the [Seqera Platform tutorials](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/getting-started/quickstart-demo/comm-showcase) to see if this might be useful to you.

### That's it for now!

**Good luck in your Nextflow journey and don't hesitate to let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) what else we could do to help.**
