# Next Steps

Congrats again on completing the **Hello nf-core** training course and thank you for completing our survey!

**Here are our top 3 recommendations for what you can do next to take your Nextflow skills to the next level.**

## 1. Get involved with the nf-core community

**The nf-core community is a welcoming, collaborative space** where you can keep learning, connect with others, and make meaningful contributions. Join the [nf-core Slack workspace](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) to ask questions, share ideas, and stay updated. Whether you attend a hackathon, help improve a pipeline, or just chat with fellow community members, getting involved is a great way to grow your skills and be part of the future of open bioinformatics.

## 2. See how Nextflow can be applied to a scientific analysis use case

**Check out the [Nextflow for Science](../nf4_science/index.md) page** for a list of short standalone courses that demonstrate how to apply the basic concepts and mechanisms presented in Hello Nextflow to common scientific analysis use cases.

If you don't see your domain represented by a relatable use case, let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) so we can add it to our development list.

## 3. Learn to master more advanced Nextflow features

In the Hello courses, we keep the level of technical complexity low on purpose to avoid overloading you with information you don't need in order to get started with Nextflow.
As you move forward with your work, you're going to want to learn how to use the full feature set and power of Nextflow.

To that end, we are currently working on a collection of Side Quests, which are meant to be short standalone courses that go deep into specific topics like testing, metadata handling, using conditional statements and the differences between working on HPC _vs._ cloud.

In the meantime, feel free to **browse the [Fundamentals Training](../basic_training/index.md) and [Advanced Training](../advanced/index.md)** to find training exercises about the topics that interest you.

### That's it for now!

**Good luck in your Nextflow journey and don't hesitate to let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) what else we could do to help.**
