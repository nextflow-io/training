# Summary

Congratulations on completing the Hello nf-core training course! 🎉

## Your journey

You started with a simple Nextflow workflow from the Hello Nextflow course: a straightforward pipeline that processed greetings through a few steps and added some ASCII art.
Through five parts, you've transformed that basic workflow into a production-ready nf-core pipeline.

### What you built

Your final `core-hello` pipeline now has:

- **Standardized structure** using the nf-core template with organized directories for workflows, subworkflows, modules, and configuration
- **Community modules** from the nf-core repository (`cat/cat`) alongside your custom modules
- **Comprehensive validation** that checks both parameters and input data before the pipeline runs
- **Professional configuration** with profiles for different execution environments
- **Complete documentation** and metadata following nf-core conventions

### Key skills acquired

Through this hands-on course, you've learned to:

1. **Navigate and understand** nf-core pipeline structure by exploring an existing pipeline
2. **Restructure workflows** to be composable and fit within the nf-core template
3. **Find and integrate** pre-built modules from the community repository
4. **Create custom modules** following nf-core standards for naming, structure, and metadata
5. **Implement validation** using nf-schema to catch errors early with clear feedback

## From research script to robust pipeline

The transformation you've made illustrates the difference between a research script and a production pipeline.
Your original Hello Nextflow workflow worked fine for its purpose, but the nf-core version you've built is:

- **More maintainable**: Standardized structure makes it easy for others (and future you) to understand
- **More reusable**: Modules can be shared across pipelines and with the community
- **More robust**: Validation catches errors before wasting compute time
- **Better documented**: Clear conventions for configuration and parameter descriptions
- **Community-ready**: Follows standards that make collaboration and contribution possible

You're now equipped with the foundational knowledge to build production-ready nf-core pipelines that follow community best practices.
