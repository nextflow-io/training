# Nextflow course - Hands-on

This hands-on session shows how to implement a Nextflow Variant Calling analysis pipeline for RNA-seq data that is based on GATK best practices.

!!! warning

    The content and pipeline in this course is aimed at teaching Nextflow, not bioinformatics. Software versions are outdated, among other things, so if you want a variant calling Nextflow pipeline for production you should use [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek), [nf-core/viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon) or [nf-core/rnavar](https://nf-co.re/rnavar) instead.

## Follow the training video

We run a free online training event for this course approximately every six months. Videos are streamed to YouTube and questions are handled in the nf-core Slack community.
