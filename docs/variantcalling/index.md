# Welcome

Welcome to our Nextflow workshop on variant calling!

In this workshop, we will recap the application of next generation sequencing to identify genetic variations in a genome. You will learn how to use the pipeline [sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek) to carry out this data-intensive workflow efficiently. We will cover topics such as experimental design, configuration of the pipeline and code execution.

Please note that this is not an introductory workshop, and we will assume some basic familiarity with Nextflow.

By the end of this workshop, you will have the skills and knowledge to run the _sarek_ workflow and customise some of its features for your own variant calling analyses.

Let's get started!
