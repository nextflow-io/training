# Environment Setup

The training courses offered on the Nextflow community training portal are optimized for use within our Gitpod environment.

Gitpod offers a virtual machine with everything already set up for you, accessible from your web browser or built into your code editor (e.g., VSCode).

If you already have a Gitpod account, click on the button below, otherwise continue in this module to set up your account for the first time.

Let's get started!
