# Part 1: Run basic operations

In this first part of the Nextflow Run training course, we ease into the topic with a very basic domain-agnostic Hello World example, which we'll use to demonstrate essential operations and point out the corresponding Nextflow code components.

!!! Tip

    A "Hello World!" is a minimalist example that is meant to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a programming language or software framework.
    The example typically consists of printing the phrase "Hello, World!" to the output device, such as the console or terminal, or writing it to a file.

## 0. Warmup: Run Hello World directly

Let's demonstrate this with a simple command that we run directly in the terminal, to show what it does before we wrap it in Nextflow.

!!! Tip

    Remember that you should now be inside the `nextflow-run/` directory as described in the Orientation.

### 0.1. Make the terminal say hello

```bash
echo 'Hello World!'
```

This outputs the text 'Hello World' to the terminal.

```console title="Output"
Hello World!
```

### 0.2. Now make it write the text output to a file

```bash
echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt
```

This does not output anything to the terminal.

```console title="Output"

```

### 0.3. Show the file contents

```bash
cat output.txt
```

The text 'Hello World' is now in the output file we specified.

```console title="output.txt" linenums="1"
Hello World!
```

!!! Tip

    In the training environment, you can also find the output file in the file explorer, and view its contents by clicking on it.

### Takeaway

You now know how to run a simple command in the terminal that outputs some text, and optionally, how to make it write the output to a file.

### What's next?

Find out what it takes to run a Nextflow workflow that achieves the same result.

---

## 1. Run the workflow

We provide you with a workflow script named `1-hello.nf` that takes an input via a command-line argument named `--greeting` and produces a text file containing that greeting.
We're not going to look at the code yet; first let's see what it looks like to run it.

### 1.1. Launch the workflow and monitor execution

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run 1-hello.nf --greeting 'Hello World!'
```

You console output should look something like this:

```console title="Output" linenums="1"
 N E X T F L O W   ~  version 25.04.3

Launching `1-hello.nf` [goofy_torvalds] DSL2 - revision: c33d41f479

executor >  local (1)
[a3/7be2fa] sayHello | 1 of 1 ✔
```

Congratulations, you just ran your first Nextflow workflow!

The most important output here is the last line (line 6):

```console title="Output" linenums="6"
[a3/7be2fa] sayHello | 1 of 1 ✔
```

This tells us that the `sayHello` process was successfully executed once (`1 of 1 ✔`).

That's great, but you may be wondering: where is the output?

### 1.2. Find the output file in the `results` directory

This workflow is configured to publish its output to a directory called `results`.
If you look at your current directory, you will see that when you ran the workflow, Nextflow created a new directory called `results`, which contains a file called `output.txt`.

```console title="results/" linenums="1"
results
└── output.txt
```

Open the file; the contents should match the string you specified on the command line.

<details>
  <summary>File contents</summary>

```console title="results/output.txt" linenums="1"
Hello World!
```

</details>

That's great, our workflow did what it was supposed to do!

However, be aware that the 'published' result is a copy (or in some cases a symlink) of the actual output produced by Nextflow when it executed the workflow.

So now, we are going to peek under the hood to see where Nextflow actually executed the work.

!!! Warning

    Not all workflows will be set up to publish outputs to a results directory, and/or the directory name may be different.
    A little further in this section, we will show you how to find out where this behavior is specified.

### 1.3. Find the original output and logs in the `work/` directory

When you run a workflow, Nextflow creates a distinct 'task directory' for every single invocation of each process in the workflow (=every step in the pipeline).
For each one, it will stage the necessary inputs, execute the relevant instruction(s) and write outputs and log files within that one directory, which is named automatically using a hash in order to make it unique.

All of these task directories will live under a directory called `work` within your current directory (where you're running the command).

That may sound confusing, so let's see what that looks like in practice.

Going back to the console output for the workflow we ran earlier, we had this line:

```console title="Excerpt of command output" linenums="6"
[a3/7be2fa] sayHello | 1 of 1 ✔
```

See how the line starts with `[a3/7be2fa]`?
That is a truncated form of the task directory path for that one process call, and tells you where to find the output of the `sayHello` process call within the `work/` directory path.

You can find the full path by typing the following command (replacing `a3/7be2fa` with what you see in your own terminal) and pressing the tab key to autocomplete the path or adding an asterisk:

```bash
ls work/a3/7be2fa*
```

This should yield the full path directory path: `work/a3/7be2fa7be2fad5e71e5f49998f795677fd68`

Let's take a look at what's in there.

!!! Tip

    If you browse the contents of the task subdirectory in the VSCode file explorer, you'll see all the files right away.
    However, the log files are set to be invisible in the terminal, so if you want to use `ls` or `tree` to view them, you'll need to set the relevant option for displaying invisible files.

    ```bash
    tree -a work
    ```

The exact subdirectory names will be different on your system.

<details>
  <summary>Directory contents</summary>

```console title="work/"
work
└── a3
    └── 7be2fad5e71e5f49998f795677fd68
        ├── .command.begin
        ├── .command.err
        ├── .command.log
        ├── .command.out
        ├── .command.run
        ├── .command.sh
        ├── .exitcode
        └── output.txt
```

</details>

You should immediately recognize the `output.txt` file, which is in fact the original output of the `sayHello` process that got published to the `results` directory.
If you open it, you will find the `Hello World!` greeting again.

<details>
  <summary>File contents</summary>

```console title="work/a3/7be2fa7be2fad5e71e5f49998f795677fd68/output.txt" linenums="1"
Hello World!
```

</details>

So what about all those other files?

These are the helper and log files that Nextflow wrote as part of the task execution:

- **`.command.begin`**: Sentinel file created as soon as the task is launched.
- **`.command.err`**: Error messages (`stderr`) emitted by the process call
- **`.command.log`**: Complete log output emitted by the process call
- **`.command.out`**: Regular output (`stdout`) by the process call
- **`.command.run`**: Full script run by Nextflow to execute the process call
- **`.command.sh`**: The command that was actually run by the process call
- **`.exitcode`**: The exit code resulting from the command

The `.command.sh` file is especially useful because it shows you the main command Nextflow executed not including all the bookkeeping and task/environment setup.

<details>
  <summary>File contents</summary>

```console title="work/a3/7be2fa7be2fad5e71e5f49998f795677fd68/command.sh" linenums="1"
#!/bin/bash -ue
echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt

```

</details>

So this confirms that the workflow composed the same command we ran directly on the command-line earlier.

!!! Tip

    When something goes wrong and you need to troubleshoot what happened, it can be useful to look at the `command.sh` script to check exactly what command Nextflow composed based on the workflow instructions, variable interpolation and so on.

### 1.4. Optional exercise: re-run with different greetings

Try re-running the workflow a few times with different values for the `--greeting` argument, then look at both the contents of the `results/` directory and the task directories.

Observe how the outputs and logs of isolated task directories are preserved, whereas the contents of the `results` directory are overwritten by the output of subsequent executions.

### Takeaway

You know how to run a simple Nextflow script, monitor its execution and find its outputs.

### What's next?

Learn how to read a basic Nextflow script and identify how its components relate to its functionality.

---

## 2. Examine the Hello World workflow starter script

What we did there was basically treating the workflow script like a black box.
Now that we've seen what it does, let's open the box and look inside.

_The goal here is not to memorize the syntax of Nextflow code, but to form some basic intuition of what are the main components and how they are organized._

### 2.1. Examine the overall code structure

Let's open the `1-hello.nf` script in the editor pane.

<details>
  <summary>Code</summary>

```groovy title="1-hello.nf" linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

/*
 * Use echo to print a greeting to a file
 */
process sayHello {

    publishDir 'results', mode: 'copy'

    input:
        val greeting

    output:
        path 'output.txt'

    script:
    """
    echo '$greeting' > output.txt
    """
}

workflow {

    // emit a greeting
    sayHello(params.greeting)
}
```

</details>

A Nextflow script involves two main types of core components: one or more **processes**, and the **workflow** itself.
Each **process** describes what operation(s) the corresponding step in the pipeline should accomplish, while the **workflow** describes the dataflow logic that connects the various steps.

Let's take a closer look at the **process** block first, then we'll look at the **workflow** block.

### 2.2. The `process` definition

The first block of code describes a **process**.
The process definition starts with the keyword `process`, followed by the process name and finally the process body delimited by curly braces.
The process body must contain a script block which specifies the command to run, which can be anything you would be able to run in a command line terminal.

Here we have a **process** called `sayHello` that takes an **input** variable called `greeting` and writes its **output** to a file named `output.txt`.

<details>
  <summary>Code</summary>

```groovy title="1-hello.nf" linenums="3"
/*
 * Use echo to print a greeting to a file
 */
process sayHello {

    publishDir 'results', mode: 'copy'

    input:
        val greeting

    output:
        path 'output.txt'

    script:
    """
    echo '$greeting' > output.txt
    """
}
```

</details>

This is a very minimal process definition that just contains an `input` definition, an `output` definition and the `script` to execute.

The `input` definition includes the `val` qualifier, which tells Nextflow to expect a value of some kind (can be a string, a number, whatever).

The `output` definition includes the `path` qualifier, which tells Nextflow this should be handled as a path (includes both directory paths and files).

!!! Tip

    The output definition does not _determine_ what output will be created.
    It simply _declares_ where to find the expected output file(s), so that Nextflow can look for it once execution is complete.

    This is necessary for verifying that the command was executed successfully and for passing the output to downstream processes if needed.
    Output produced that doesn't match what is declared in the output block will not be passed to downstream processes.

In a real-world pipeline, a process usually contains additional information uch as process directives, which we'll introduce in a little bit.

### 2.3. The `workflow` definition

The second block of code describes the **workflow** itself.
The workflow definition starts with the keyword `workflow`, followed by an optional name, then the workflow body delimited by curly braces.

Here we have a **workflow** that consists of one call to the `sayHello` process, which takes an input, `params.greeting`, which holds the value we gave to the `--greeting` parameter.

```groovy title="1-hello.nf" linenums="22"
workflow {

    // emit a greeting
    sayHello(params.greeting)
}
```

This is a very minimal **workflow** definition.
In a real-world pipeline, the workflow typically contains multiple calls to **processes** connected by **channels**, and there may be default values set up for the variable inputs.

We'll look into that in Part 2 of the course.

### 2.4. The `params` system of command-line parameters

The `params.greeting` we provide to the `sayHello()` process call is a neat bit of Nextflow code and is worth spending an extra minute on.

As mentioned above, that's how we pass the value of the `--greeting` command-line parameter to the `sayHello()` process call.
In fact, simply declaring `params.someParameterName` will enable us to give the workflow a parameter named `--someParameterName` from the command-line.

!!! Tip

    These workflow parameters declared using the `params` system always take two dashes (`--`).
    This distinguishes them from Nextflow-level parameters, which only take one dash (`-`).

### Takeaway

You now know how a simple Nextflow workflow is structured, and how the basic components relate to its functionality.

### What's next?

Learn to manage your workflow executions conveniently.

---

## 3. Manage workflow executions

Knowing how to launch workflows and retrieve outputs is great, but you'll quickly find there are a few other aspects of workflow management that will make your life easier.

Here we show you how to take advantage of the `resume` feature for when you need to re-launch the same workflow, how to inspect the execution logs with `nextflow log`, and how to delete older work directories with `nextflow clean`.

### 3.1. Re-launch a workflow with `-resume`

Sometimes, you're going to want to re-run a pipeline that you've already launched previously without redoing any work that was already completed successfully.

Nextflow has an option called `-resume` that allows you to do this.
Specifically, in this mode, any processes that have already been run with the exact same code, settings and inputs will be skipped.
This means Nextflow will only run processes that you've added or modified since the last run, or to which you're providing new settings or inputs.

There are two key advantages to doing this:

- If you're in the middle of developing a pipeline, you can iterate more rapidly since you only have to run the process(es) you're actively working on in order to test your changes.
- If you're running a pipeline in production and something goes wrong, in many cases you can fix the issue and relaunch the pipeline, and it will resume running from the point of failure, which can save you a lot of time and compute.

To use it, simply add `-resume` to your command and run it:

```bash
nextflow run 1-hello.nf --greeting 'Hello World!' -resume
```

The console output should look similar.

<details>
  <summary>Command output</summary>

```console linenums="1"
 N E X T F L O W   ~  version 25.04.3

Launching `1-hello.nf` [tiny_noyce] DSL2 - revision: c33d41f479

[a3/7be2fa] process > sayHello [100%] 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
```

</details>

Look for the `cached:` bit that has been added in the process status line (line 5), which means that Nextflow has recognized that it has already done this work and simply reused the result from the previous successful run.

You can also see that the work subdirectory hash is the same as in the previous run.
Nextflow is literally pointing you to the previous execution and saying "I already did that over there."

!!! Tip

    When your re-run a pipeline with `resume`, Nextflow does not overwrite any files written to a `publishDir` directory by any process call that was previously run successfully.

### 3.2. Inspect the log of past executions

Whenever you launch a nextflow workflow, a line gets written to a log file called `history`, under a hidden directory called `.nextflow` in the current working directory.

<details>
  <summary>File contents</summary>

```txt title=".nextflow/history" linenums="1"
2025-07-04 19:27:09	1.8s	wise_watson	OK	3539118582ccde68dde471cc2c66295c	a02c9c46-c3c7-4085-9139-d1b9b5b194c8	nextflow run 1-hello.nf --greeting 'Hello World'

```

</details>

This file gives you the timestamp, run name, status, revision ID, session ID and full command line for every Nextflow run that has been launched from within the current working directory.

A more convenient way to access this information is to use the `nextflow log` command.

```bash
nextflow log
```

This will output the contents of the log file to the terminal, augmented with a header line.

<details>
  <summary>Command output</summary>

```

</details>

You'll notice that the session ID changes whenever you run a new `nextflow run` command, EXCEPT if you're using the `-resume` option.
In that case, the session ID stays the same.

Nextflow uses the session ID to group run caching information under the `cache` directory, also located under `.nextflow`.

### 3.3. Delete older work directories

During the development process, you'll typically run your draft pipelines a large number of times, which can lead to an accumulation of very many files across many subdirectories.
Since the subdirectories are named randomly, it is difficult to tell from their names what are older vs. more recent runs.

Nextflow includes a convenient `clean` subcommand that can automatically delete the work subdirectories for past runs that you no longer care about, with several [options](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/cli.html#clean) to control what will be deleted.

Here we show you an example that deletes all subdirectories from runs before a given run, specified using its run name.
The run name is the machine-generated two-part string shown in square brackets in the `Launching (...)` console output line, which we also saw recorded in the Nextflow log that we looked at earlier.

You can use the Nextflow log to look up a run based on its timestamp and/or command line.

Once we have that, first we try the `nextflow clean` command using the dry run flag `-n` to check what will be deleted:

```bash
nextflow clean -before backstabbing_swartz -n
```

The output will have different task directory names and may have a different number of lines, but it should look similar to the example given below.

<details>
  <summary>Command output</summary>

```console title="Output"
Would remove /workspaces/training/hello-nextflow/work/eb/1a5de36637b475afd88fca7f79e024
Would remove /workspaces/training/hello-nextflow/work/6b/19b0e002ea13486d3a0344c336c1d0
Would remove /workspaces/training/hello-nextflow/work/45/9a6dd7ab771f93003d040956282883
```

</details>

If you don't see any lines output, you either did not provide a valid run name or there are no past runs to delete.

If the output looks as expected and you want to proceed with the deletion, re-run the command with the `-f` flag instead of `-n`:

```bash
nextflow clean -before backstabbing_swartz -f
```

The output should be similar to before, but now saying 'Removed' instead of 'Would remove'.

<details>
  <summary>Command output</summary>

```console title="Output"
Removed /workspaces/training/hello-nextflow/work/eb/1a5de36637b475afd88fca7f79e024
Removed /workspaces/training/hello-nextflow/work/6b/19b0e002ea13486d3a0344c336c1d0
Removed /workspaces/training/hello-nextflow/work/45/9a6dd7ab771f93003d040956282883
```

</details>

!!! Warning

    Deleting work subdirectories from past runs removes them from Nextflow's cache and deletes any outputs that were stored in those directories.
    That means it breaks Nextflow's ability to resume execution without re-running the corresponding processes.

    You are responsible for saving any outputs that you care about or plan to rely on! If you're using the `publishDir` directive for that purpose, make sure to use the `copy` mode, not the `symlink` mode.

### Takeaway

You know how to relaunch a pipeline without repeating steps that were already run in an identical way, inspect the execution log, and use the `nextflow clean` command to clean up old work directories.

### What's next?

Take a little break! You've just absorbed the building blocks of Nextflow syntax and basic usage instructions.

In the next section of this training, we're going to look at four successively more realistic versions of the Hello World pipeline that will demonstrate how Nextflow allows you to process multiple inputs efficiently, run workflows composed of multiple steps connected together, leverage modular code components, and utilize containers for greater reproducibility and portability.
