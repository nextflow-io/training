# Next Steps

Congrats again on completing the Nextflow Run training course and thank you for completing our survey!

## 1. Top 3 ways to level up your Nextflow skills

Here are our top three recommendations for what to do next based on the course you just completed.

### 1.1. Get started with nf-core

**[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/)** is a worldwide collaborative effort to develop standardized open-source pipelines for a wide range of scientific research applications.\*\*
The project includes [over 100 pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/) that are available for use out of the box and [well over 1400 process modules](https://nf-co.re/modules/) that can be integrated into your own projects, as well as a rich set of developer tools.

The **[Hello nf-core](../../hello_nf-core/index.md)** training course is a hands-on introduction you to the nf-core project and its rich set of community-curated pipelines.
Part 1 covers how to find and use existing nf-core pipelines, which can save you a lot of time and effort.

The rest of the training covers how to adopt nf-core standards and conventions in your own work, work with nf-core modules, and contribute back to the project.
You may not need to work through that part of the material if you don't plan to develop your own pipelines.

### 1.2. Apply Nextflow to a scientific analysis use case

**Check out the [Nextflow for Science](../nf4_science/index.md) page** for a list of short standalone courses that demonstrate how to apply the basic concepts and mechanisms presented in Nextflow Run to common scientific analysis use cases.
Note that these are intended for people who wish to learn to develop their on pipelines.

If you don't see your domain represented by a relatable use case, let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) or by [creating an issue in the training repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/training/issues/new/choose) so we can add it to our to-do list.

### 1.3. Delve deeper into the code

If the Nextflow Run course left you hungry for more details about how Nextflow works, you may want to work through the [Hello Nextflow](../hello_nextflow/index.md) course.
That course is the long version of the same basic tutorial, with more step-by-step dissection of the code features and mechanisms featured in the Hello pipeline.

Or, if that feels too repetitive and you're itching to jump into the deep end, check out our growing **collection of [Side Quests](../side_quests/index.md)**. Those are meant to be short standalone courses that go deep into specific topics like testing and metadata handling.

## 2. Check out Seqera Platform

**[Seqera Platform](https://seqera.io/) is the best way to run Nextflow in practice.**

It is a cloud-based platform developed by the creators of Nextflow that you can connect to your own compute infrastructure (whether local, HPC or cloud) to make it much easier to launch and manage your workflows, as well as manage your data and run analyses interactively in a cloud environment.

The Free Tier is available for free use by everyone (with usage quotas).
Qualifying academics can get free Pro-level access (no usage limitations) through the [Academic Program](https://seqera.io/academic/program/).

Have a look at the [Seqera Platform tutorials](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/getting-started/quickstart-demo/comm-showcase) to see if this might be useful to you.

### That's it for now!

**Good luck in your Nextflow journey and don't hesitate to let us know in the [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/) what else we could do to help.**
