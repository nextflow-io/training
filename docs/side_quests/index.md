## Prerequisites

The specific prerequisites of each mini-courses vary and are documented in the corresponding pages.
Nevertheless, they all assume some minimal familiarity with the following:

- Experience with the command line
- Foundational Nextflow concepts and tooling covered in the [Hello Nextflow](../../hello_nextflow/) beginner training course.

For technical requirements and environment setup, see the [Environment Setup](../../envsetup/) mini-course.
