# Side Quests

This is a collection of standalone training mini-courses that go deeper into specific topics. You can go through them in any order.

Let's get started! Click on the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button below to launch the training environment (preferably in a separate tab), then read on while it loads.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/nextflow-io/training?quickstart=1&ref=master)

## Prerequisites

The specific prerequisites of each mini-courses vary and are documented in the corresponding pages.
Nevertheless, they all assume some minimal familiarity with the following:

- Experience with the command line
- Foundational Nextflow concepts and tooling covered in the [Hello Nextflow](../../hello_nextflow/) beginner training course.

For technical requirements and environment setup, see the [Environment Setup](../../envsetup/) mini-course.

**If this is the first time you delve into the Side Quests, make sure to check out the [Orientation](./orientation.md) page first!**

Otherwise, select a side quest from the table below.
