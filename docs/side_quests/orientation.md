# Orientation

The GitHub Codespaces environment contains all the software, code and data necessary to work through this training course, so you don't need to install anything yourself.
However, you do need a (free) account to log in, and you should take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the interface.

If you have not yet done so, please follow [this link](../../envsetup/) before going any further.

## Materials provided

Throughout this training course, we'll be working in the `tapas/` directory.
This directory contains all the code files, test data and accessory files you will need.

Feel free to explore the contents of this directory; the easiest way to do so is to use the file explorer on the left-hand side of the GitHub Codespaces workspace.
Alternatively, you can use the `tree` command.
Throughout the course, we use the output of `tree` to represent directory structure and contents in a readable form, sometimes with minor modifications for clarity.

Here we generate a table of contents to the second level down:

```bash
tree . -L 2
```

If you run this inside `tapas`, you should see the following output: [TODO]

```console title="Directory contents"
.
```

!!!note

    Don't worry if this seems like a lot; we'll go through the relevant pieces at each step of the course.
    This is just meant to give you an overview.

**Here's a summary of what you should know to get started:**

    If for whatever reason you move out of this directory, you can always run this command to return to it:

    ```bash
    cd /workspaces/training/tapas
    ```
