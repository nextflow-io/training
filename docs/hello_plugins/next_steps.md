# Next Steps

Congratulations on completing the **Hello Plugins** training course and thank you for completing our survey.

## 1. Top 3 ways to continue your plugin journey

Here are our top three recommendations for what to do next based on the course you just completed.

### 1.1. Explore the plugin registry

**Browse the [Nextflow Plugin Registry](https://registry.nextflow.io/)** to see what plugins are available.
You'll find plugins for:

- Input validation (nf-schema)
- Cloud platform integration (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Notifications (Slack, Teams)
- Provenance tracking
- And much more

Understanding what's already available can save you time and inspire ideas for your own plugins.

### 1.2. Study existing plugin source code

**Look at the source code of popular plugins** to see how they're structured and implemented.
The [nf-hello](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello) plugin is intentionally simple and well-documented.
The [official plugins repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins) contains more complex examples including executors and filesystem implementations.

### 1.3. Build something useful

**The best way to learn is by building.**
Think about functionality you've wanted in Nextflow but couldn't find.
Some ideas:

- Custom logging or reporting for your organization
- Integration with internal tools or APIs
- Domain-specific utility functions
- Notifications to your preferred platform

Start small, get it working, then iterate.

## 2. Get help from the community

**The Nextflow community is friendly and helpful.**

- [Nextflow Slack](https://www.nextflow.io/slack-invite.html): Ask questions and share your work
- [Community forum](https://community.seqera.io/): Discuss ideas and get advice
- [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/discussions): Technical questions and feature requests

If you build a useful plugin, consider sharing it with the community through the plugin registry.
