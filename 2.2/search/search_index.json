In this chapter, we create a very small Workflow using the FastP tool to investigate importing the Groovy JSONSlurper class.</p> <p>First, let's move into the chapter 4 directory:</p> <pre><code>cd groovy\n</code></pre> <p>Let's assume that we would like to pull in a samplesheet, parse the entries and run them through the FastP tool. So far, we have been concerned with local files, but Nextflow will handle remote files transparently:</p> <pre><code>workflow {\n    params.input = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/rnaseq/samplesheet/v3.10/samplesheet_test.csv\"\n\n    Channel.fromPath(params.input)\n    | splitCsv(header: true)\n    | view\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Let's write a small closure to parse each row into the now-familiar map + files shape. We might start by constructing the meta-map:</p> <pre><code>workflow {\n    params.input = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/rnaseq/samplesheet/v3.10/samplesheet_test.csv\"\n\n    Channel.fromPath(params.input)\n    | splitCsv(header: true)\n    | map { row -&gt;\n        meta = row.subMap('sample', 'strandedness')\n        meta\n    }\n    | view\n}\n</code></pre> <p>... but this precludes the possibility of adding additional columns to the samplesheet. We might to ensure the parsing will capture any extra metadata columns should they be added. Instead, let's partition the column names into those that begin with \"fastq\" and those that don't:</p> <pre><code>(readKeys, metaKeys) = row.keySet().split { it =~ /^fastq/ }\n</code></pre> <p>New methods</p> <p>We've introduced a new keySet method here. This is a method on Java's LinkedHashMap class (docs here)</p> <p>We're also using the <code>.split()</code> method, which divides collection based on the return value of the closure. The mrhaki blog provides a succinct summary.</p> <p>From here, let's</p> <pre><code>reads = row.subMap(readKeys).values().collect { file(it) }\n</code></pre> <p>... but we run into an error:</p> <pre><code>Argument of `file` function cannot be empty\n</code></pre> <p>If we have a closer look at the samplesheet, we notice that not all rows have two read pairs. Let's add a condition</p> <pre><code>reads = row\n.subMap(readKeys)\n.values()\n.findAll { it != \"\" } // Single-end reads will have an empty string\n.collect { file(it) } // Turn those strings into paths\n</code></pre> <p>Now we need to construct the meta map. Let's have a quick look at the FASTP module that I've already pre-defined:</p> <pre><code>process FASTP {\n    container 'quay.io/biocontainers/fastp:0.23.2--h79da9fb_0'\n\n    input:\n    tuple val(meta), path(reads)\n\n    output:\n    tuple val(meta), path('*.fastp.fastq.gz') , optional:true, emit: reads\n    tuple val(meta), path('*.json')           , emit: json\n\n    script:\n    def prefix = task.ext.prefix ?: meta.id\n    if (meta.single_end) {\n        // SNIP\n    } else {\n        // SNIP\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>I can see that we require two extra keys, <code>id</code> and <code>single_end</code>:</p> <pre><code>meta = row.subMap(metaKeys)\nmeta.id ?= meta.sample\nmeta.single_end = reads.size == 1\n</code></pre> <p>This is now able to be passed through to our FASTP process:</p> <pre><code>Channel.fromPath(params.input)\n| splitCsv(header: true)\n| map { row -&gt;\n    (readKeys, metaKeys) = row.keySet().split { it =~ /^fastq/ }\n    reads = row.subMap(readKeys).values()\n    .findAll { it != \"\" } // Single-end reads will have an empty string\n    .collect { file(it) } // Turn those strings into paths\n    meta = row.subMap(metaKeys)\n    meta.id ?= meta.sample\n    meta.single_end = reads.size == 1\n    [meta, reads]\n}\n| FASTP\n\nFASTP.out.json | view\n</code></pre> <p>Let's assume that we want to pull some information out of these JSON files. To make our lives a little more convenient, let's \"publish\" these json files so that they are more convenient. We're going to discuss configuration more completely in a later chapter, but that's no reason not to dabble a bit here.</p> <p>We'd like to add a <code>publishDir</code> directive to our FASTP process.</p> <pre><code>process {\n    withName: 'FASTP' {\n        publishDir = [\n            path: { \"results/fastp/json\" },\n            saveAs: { filename -&gt; filename.endsWith('.json') ? filename : null },\n        ]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Groovy Tip: Elvis Operator</p> <p>This pattern of returning something if it is true and <code>somethingElse</code> if not:</p> <pre><code>somethingThatMightBeFalsey ? somethingThatMightBeFalsey : somethingElse\n</code></pre> <p>has a shortcut in Groovy - the \"Elvis\" operator:</p> <pre><code>somethingThatMightBeFalsey ?: somethingElse\n</code></pre> <p>This enables us to iterate quickly to test out our JSON parsing without waiting on the FASTP caching to calculate on these slow virtual machines.</p> <pre><code>nextflow run . -resume\n</code></pre> <p>Let's consider the possibility that we'd like to capture some of these metrics so that they can be used downstream. First, we'll have a quick peek at the Groovy docs and I see that I need to import a <code>JsonSlurper</code>:</p> <pre><code>import groovy.json.JsonSlurper\n\n// We can also import a Yaml parser just as easily:\n//   import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml\n//   new Yaml().load(new FileReader('your/data.yml'))\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's create a second entrypoint to quickly pass these JSON files through some tests:</p> <p>Entrypoint developing</p> <p>Using a second Entrypoint allows us to do quick debugging or development using a small section of the workflow without disturbing the main flow.</p> <pre><code>workflow Jsontest {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"results/fastp/json/*.json\")\n    | view\n}\n</code></pre> <p>which we run with</p> <pre><code>nextflow run . -resume -entry Jsontest\n</code></pre> <p>Let's create a small function at the top of the workflow to take the JSON path and pull out some basic metrics:</p> <pre><code>def getFilteringResult(json_file) {\n    fastpResult = new JsonSlurper().parseText(json_file.text)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Exercise</p> <p>The <code>fastpResult</code> returned from the <code>parseText</code> method is a large Map - a class which we're already familiar with. Modify the <code>getFilteringResult</code> function to return just the <code>after_filtering</code> section of the report.</p> Solution <p>Here is one potential solution.</p> <pre><code>def getFilteringResult(json_file) {\n    new JsonSlurper().parseText(json_file.text)\n    ?.summary\n    ?.after_filtering\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p><code>?.</code> is new notation is a null-safe access operator. The <code>?.summary</code> will access the summary property if the property exists.</p> <p>We can then join this new map back to the original reads using the <code>join</code> operator:</p> <pre><code>FASTP.out.json\n| map { meta, json -&gt; [meta, getFilteringResult(json)] }\n| join( FASTP.out.reads )\n| view\n</code></pre> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Can you amend this pipeline to create two channels that filter the reads to exclude any samples where the Q30 rate is less than 93.5%?</p> Solution <pre><code>FASTP.out.json\n| map { meta, json -&gt; [meta, getFilteringResult(json)] }\n| join( FASTP.out.reads )\n| map { meta, fastpMap, reads -&gt; [meta + fastpMap, reads] }\n| branch { meta, reads -&gt;\n    pass: meta.q30_rate &gt;= 0.935\n    fail: true\n}\n| set { reads }\n\nreads.fail | view { meta, reads -&gt; \"Failed: ${meta.id}\" }\nreads.pass | view { meta, reads -&gt; \"Passed: ${meta.id}\" }\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"advanced/grouping/","title":"Grouping and Splitting","text":""},{"location":"advanced/grouping/#grouping-using-submap","title":"Grouping using subMap","text":"<p>Now that we have a channel that conforms to the <code>tuple val(meta) path(&lt;something&gt;)</code> pattern, we can investigate splitting and grouping patterns.</p> <p>We'll start with a simple main.nf in the <code>grouping</code> directory</p> <pre><code>cd grouping\n</code></pre> <pre><code>workflow {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header:true )\n    | map { row -&gt;\n        meta = [id:row.id, repeat:row.repeat, type:row.type]\n        [meta, [\n            file(row.fastq1, checkIfExists: true),\n            file(row.fastq2, checkIfExists: true)]]\n    }\n    | view\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The first change we're going to make is to correct some repetitive code that we've seen quite a lot already in this workshop. The construction of the meta map from this row stutters quite a lot.

This method, in combination with the <code>plus</code> or <code>+</code> method for combining maps and resetting values should allow all contraction, expansion and modification of maps safely.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Can you extend our workflow in an unsafe manner?

We can create a new class in <code>./lib/Metadata.groovy</code>.

Let's change that by adding a constructor to the class:</p> <pre><code>class Metadata extends HashMap {\n    Metadata(String location) {\n        this.location = location\n    }\n\n    def hi() {\n        return this.location ? \"Hello, from ${this.location}!\" : \"Hello, workshop participants!\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Which we can use like so:</p> <pre><code>workflow {\n    Channel.of(\"Montreal\")\n    | map { place -&gt; new Metadata(place) }\n    | view { it.hi() }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We can also use this method when passing the object to a process:</p> <pre><code>process UseMeta {\n    input: val(meta)\n    output: path(\"out.txt\")\n    script: \"echo '${meta.hi()}' | tee out.txt\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of(\"Montreal\")\n    | map { place -&gt; new Metadata(place) }\n    | UseMeta\n    | view\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Why might this be helpful? You can add extra classes to the metadata which can be computed from the existing metadata. For example, we might want to grab the adapter prefix:</p> <pre><code>def getAdapterStart() {\n    this.adapter?.substring(0, 3)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Which we might use like so:</p> <pre><code>process UseMeta {\n    input: val(meta)\n    output: path(\"out.txt\")\n    script: \"echo '${meta.adapter} prefix is ${meta.getAdapterStart()}' | tee out.txt\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of(\"Montreal\")\n    | map { place -&gt; new Metadata(place) }\n    | map { it + [adapter:\"AACGTAGCTTGAC\"] }\n    | UseMeta\n    | view\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You might even want to reach out to external services such as a LIMS or the E-utilities API. Here we add a dummy \"getSampleName()\" method that reaches out to a public API:</p> <pre><code>def getSampleName() {\n    def get = new URL('https://postman-echo.com/get?sampleName=Fido').openConnection()\n    def getRC = get.getResponseCode();\n    if (getRC.equals(200)) {\n        JsonSlurper jsonSlurper = new JsonSlurper()\n        def json = jsonSlurper.parseText(get.getInputStream().getText())\n        return json.args.sampleName\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Which we can use like so:</p> <pre><code>process UseMeta {\n    input: val(meta)\n    output: path(\"out.txt\")\n    script:\n    \"echo '${meta.adapter} prefix is ${meta.getAdapterStart()} with sampleName ${meta.getSampleName()}' | tee out.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Nextflow caching</p> <p>When we start passing custom classes through the workflow, it's important to understand a little about the Nextflow caching mechanism. When a task is run, a unique hash is calculated based on the task name, the input files/values, and the input parameters. Our class extends from <code>HashMap</code>, which means that the hash will be calculated based on the contents of the <code>HashMap</code>. If we add a new method to the class, or amend a class method, this does not change the value of the objects in the hash, which means that the hash will not change.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Can you show changing a method in our <code>Metadata</code> class does not change the hash?</p> Solution <p>We might increase the length of the adapter prefix to 5 characters:</p> <pre><code>    def getAdapterStart() {\n        this.adapter?.substring(0, 5)\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Changing this method and resuming the workflow will not change the hash, and the existing method will be used.</p> <p>We are not limited to using or extending the built-in Groovy classes.

This is because a process may spawn multiple tasks, which can run in parallel. For example, the operation on the second element may end sooner than the operation on the first element, changing the output channel order.</p> <p>In practical terms, consider the following snippet:</p> snippet.nf<pre><code>process FOO {\n    input:\n    val x\n\n    output:\n    stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    sleep \\$((RANDOM % 3))\n    echo -n \"$x\"\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess BAR {\n    input:\n    val x\n\n    output:\n    stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    echo -n \"$x\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess FOOBAR {\n    input:\n    val foo\n    val bar\n\n    output:\n    stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    echo $foo - $bar\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n    ch_letters = channel.of('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')\n    FOO(ch_letters)\n    BAR(ch_letters)\n    FOOBAR(FOO.out, BAR.out).view()\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Processes FOO and BAR receive the same inputs, and return something on standard output. Somebody wrote process FOOBAR to receive those processed outputs and generate combined output, from matched inputs. But even though we set the order of the input values, the FOO and BAR processes output whenever their tasks are complete, not respecting input order. So FOOBAR receiving the outputs of those channels, will not receive them in the same order, as you can see from the output:</p> Output<pre><code>...\nB - c\n\nD - a\n\nC - d\n\nA - b\n</code></pre> <p>So D is matched with 'a' here, which was not the intention. That order will likely be different every time the workflow is run, meaning that the processing will not be deterministic, and caching will also not work, since the inputs to FOOBAR will vary constantly.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Re-run the above code a couple of times using <code>-resume</code>, and determine if the FOOBAR process reruns, or uses cached results.</p> Solution <p>You should see that while FOO and BAR reliably re-use their cache, FOOBAR will re-run at least a subset of its tasks due to differences in the combinations of inputs it receives.</p> <p>The output will look like this:</p> Output<pre><code> [58/f117ed] FOO (4)    [100%] 4 of 4, cached: 4 \u2714\n [84/e88fd9] BAR (4)    [100%] 4 of 4, cached: 4 \u2714\n [6f/d3f672] FOOBAR (1) [100%] 4 of 4, cached: 2 \u2714\n D - c\n\n A - d\n\n C - a\n\n B - b\n</code></pre> <p>A common solution for this is to use what is commonly referred to as a meta map. A groovy object with sample information is passed out together with the file results within an output channel as a tuple. This can then be used to pair samples from separate channels together for downstream use.</p> <p>To illustrate, here is a change to the above workflow, with meta maps added:</p> snippet.nf<pre><code>process FOO {\n    input:\n    tuple val(meta), val(x)\n\n    output:\n    tuple val(meta), stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    sleep \\$((RANDOM % 3))\n    echo -n \"$x\"\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess BAR {\n    input:\n    tuple val(meta), val(x)\n\n    output:\n    tuple val(meta), stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    echo -n \"$x\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess FOOBAR {\n    input:\n    tuple val(meta), val(foo), val(bar)\n\n    output:\n    stdout\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    echo $foo - $bar\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n    ch_letters = channel.of(\n        [[id: 'A'], 'A'],\n        [[id: 'B'], 'B'],\n        [[id: 'C'], 'C'],\n        [[id: 'D'], 'D']\n    )\n    FOO(ch_letters)\n    BAR(ch_letters)\n    FOOBAR(FOO.out.join(BAR.out)).view()\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we define <code>ch_letters</code> with a meta map (e.g. <code>[id: 'A']</code>). Both FOO and BAR pass the <code>meta</code> through and attach it to their outputs. Then, in our call to FOOBAR we can use a <code>join</code> operation to ensure that only matched values are passed. Running this code provides us with matched processes, as we'd expect:</p> Output<pre><code>...\nD - d\n\nB - b\n\nA - a\n\nC - c\n</code></pre> <p>If meta maps are not possible, an alternative is to use the <code>fair</code> process directive. When this directive is specified, Nextflow will guarantee that the order of outputs will match the order of inputs (not the order in which the tasks run, only the order of the output channel).</p>

The <code>it</code> identifier is an implicit variable that represents the value that is passed to the function when it is invoked.</p> <p>Once compiled, the function object is assigned to the variable <code>square</code> as any other variable assignment shown previously.</p> <p>To invoke the closure execution use the special method <code>call</code> or just use the round parentheses to specify the closure parameter(s):</p> snippet.nf<pre><code>assert square.call(5) == 25\nassert square(9) == 81\n</code></pre> <p>As is, this may not seem interesting, but you can now pass the <code>square</code> function as an argument to other functions or methods. Some built-in functions take a function like this as an argument. One example is the <code>collect</code> method on lists:</p> snippet.nf<pre><code>x = [1, 2, 3, 4].collect(square)\nprintln x\n</code></pre> Output<pre><code>[1, 4, 9, 16]\n</code></pre> <p>By default, closures take a single parameter called <code>it</code>.</p> <p>To give it a different name use the <code>-&gt;</code> syntax. For example:</p> snippet.nf<pre><code>square = { num -&gt; num * num }\n</code></pre> <p>It\u2019s also possible to define closures with multiple, custom-named parameters.</p> <p>For example, when the method <code>each()</code> is applied to a map it can take a closure with two arguments, to which it passes the key-value pair for each entry in the <code>map</code> object. For example:</p> snippet.nf<pre><code>printMap = { a, b -&gt; println \"$a with value $b\" } // (1)!\nvalues = [\"Yue\": \"Wu\", \"Mark\": \"Williams\", \"Sudha\": \"Kumari\"] // (2)!\nvalues.each(printMap) // (3)!\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Closure object that prints the key-value pair.</li> <li>Defines a map object with three entries.</li> <li>Invokes the <code>each</code> method passing the closure object.</li> </ol> Output<pre><code>Yue with value Wu\nMark with value Williams\nSudha with value Kumari\n</code></pre> <p>A closure has two other important features.</p> <p>First, it can access and modify variables in the scope where it is defined.</p> <p>Second, a closure can be defined in an anonymous manner, meaning that it is not given a name, and is only defined in the place where it needs to be used.</p> <p>As an example showing both these features, see the following code fragment:</p> snippet.nf<pre><code>result = 0 // (1)!\nvalues = [\"China\": 1, \"India\": 2, \"USA\": 3] // (2)!\nvalues.keySet().each { result += values[it] } // (3)!\nprintln result\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Defines a global variable.</li> <li>Defines a map object.</li> <li>Invokes the <code>each</code> method passing the closure object which modifies the <code>result</code> variable.</li> </ol> Output<pre><code>6\n</code></pre> <p>Learn more about closures in the Groovy documentation.</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>In this step you have learned:</p> <ol> <li>How to define a closure in Groovy</li> <li>How to invoke a closure</li> </ol>"},{"location":"basic_training/groovy/#more-resources","title":"More resources","text":"<p>The complete Groovy language documentation is available at this link.</p> <p>A great resource to master Apache Groovy syntax is the book: Groovy in Action.</p>"},{"location":"basic_training/intro/","title":"Basic concepts","text":"<p>Nextflow is a workflow orchestration engine and domain-specific language (DSL) that makes it easy to write data-intensive computational workflows.</p> <p>It is designed around the idea that the Linux platform is the lingua franca of data science.

Determine what executor(s) should be used to do the work","text":"<p>Until now, we have been running our pipeline with the local executor. This executes each task on the machine that Nextflow is running on. When Nextflow begins, it looks at the available CPUs and memory. If the resources of the tasks ready to run exceed the available resources, Nextflow will hold the last tasks back from execution until one or more of the earlier tasks have finished, freeing up the necessary resources.</p> <p>For very large workloads, you may discover that your local machine is a bottleneck, either because you have a single task that requires more resources than you have available, or because you have so many tasks that waiting for a single machine to run them would take too long. The local executor is convenient and efficient, but is limited to that single machine. Nextflow supports many different execution backends, including HPC schedulers (Slurm, LSF, SGE, PBS, Moab, OAR, Bridge, HTCondor and others) as well as cloud execution backends such (AWS Batch, Google Cloud Batch, Azure Batch, Kubernetes and more).</p> <p>Each of these systems uses different technologies, syntaxes and configurations for defining how a job should be defined. For example, /if we didn't have Nextflow/, a job requiring 8 CPUs and 4GB of RAM to be executed on the queue \"my-science-work\" would need to include the following configuration on SLURM and submit the job using <code>sbatch</code>:</p> <pre><code>#SBATCH -o /path/to/my/task/directory/my-task-1.log\n#SBATCH --no-requeue\n#SBATCH -c 8\n#SBATCH --mem 4096M\n#SBATCH -p my-science-work\n</code></pre> <p>If I wanted to make the workflow available to a colleague running on PBS, I'd need to remember to use a different submission program <code>qsub</code> and I'd need to change my scripts to use a new syntax for resources:</p> <pre><code>#PBS -o /path/to/my/task/directory/my-task-1.log\n#PBS -j oe\n#PBS -q my-science-work\n#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=5\n#PBS -l mem=4gb\n</code></pre> <p>If I wanted to use SGE, the configuration would be slightly different again:</p> <pre><code>#$ -o /path/to/my/task/directory/my-task-1.log\n#$ -j y\n#$ -terse\n#$ -notify\n#$ -q my-science-work\n#$ -l slots=5\n#$ -l h_rss=4096M,mem_free=4096M\n</code></pre> <p>Running on a single cloud execution engine would require a new approach again, likely using an SDK that uses the cloud platform's APIs.</p> <p>Nextflow makes it easy to write a single workflow that can be run on each of these different infrastructures and systems, without having to modify the workflow.

And also you don't have to define all the files which are created by a process as an output.</p> <p>Nextflow will only copy the things which are defined in this output block. So if you have intermediate files created by the step, which are not needed downstream of this process, you just don't define them in output and they won't turn up in the publishDir. So this is a way of keeping your output files from a pipeline clean and easily deleting intermediate files once the workplace finished.</p> <p>A quick note here. There's some new Nextflow syntax coming called workflow output definitions, which will eventually replace publishDir. This gives us a way to define all the outputs from a workflow at pipeline level down in the workflow block. This is described in the Nextflow docs if you wanna give it a try. But for now, publishDir will be around for a while, so still have that in a training for 2025.</p>"},{"location":"hello_nextflow/transcripts/01_hello_world/#32-re-launch-a-workflow-with-resume","title":"3.2. Re-launch a workflow with -resume","text":"<p>Okay. I mentioned that the work directory here now has two sets of results with a different hash from each time we run the workflow. That's good. However, sometimes we don't want to recompute steps every time if we don't need to.</p> <p>Maybe you are iteratively building your workflow and you're adding steps in and you want the first steps just to reuse the cached versions. Or maybe something went wrong on your compute system halfway through your workflow and you want it to carry on from where it left off, but skip the steps it had already completed.</p> <p>Nextflow has built-in functionality for this called resume. Let's try it out. So first off, I'm going to just have a look at the work directory so we can remember what was there.</p> <p>And then I'm going to do \"nextflow run hello-world.nf\" and I'm going to add a single command here, \"-resume\".</p> <p>Note, single dash, that's really important. I'm going to run it and the output's going to look basically exactly the same, with a couple of small differences.</p> <p>Note here it says \"cached\" in gray. That means that Nextflow didn't run the task. This time it found something that matched what were requirements and it reused those outputs directly rather than rerunning the step.</p> <p>And sure enough, if you look at the hash here, you can see this corresponds to the existing hash that we had from a previous run.</p>"},{"location":"hello_nextflow/transcripts/01_hello_world/#33-delete-older-work-directories","title":"3.3. Delete older work directories","text":"<p>Okay. But if you are developing iteratively, you're going to build up a lot of these workflow files. That can be a problem if you might be short on space.</p> <p>Nextflow can help us clean up these work directories with a couple of helper commands. If I do \"nextflow log\". That will give me a list of all the different workflow runs that I've done in this directory, and they have the run names here. You can see the gloomy quick one, which was the first one we ran, and then these two new ones.</p> <p>We can now take that name and use those with the \"nextflow clean\" command. I can specify a single run name. Or even better, I can tell Nextflow to delete everything from before a single workflow name with \"-before\", and I'm going to put in \"stupefied_shaw\". That was my most recent run, \"-n\".</p> <p>The \"-n\" command told Nextflow to do it as a dry run without actually deleting anything for real, and it tells us which of the hash directories it would've been removed. Sure enough, it's just that one from the first execution. Both of the second executions use the same hash directory.</p> <p>I am going to run it again, but now instead of \"-n\" for dry run, I'm going to do \"-f\" for force and it has removed that hash directory. Now if I do \"tree work\", we can see, we just have this output file left.</p> <p>Great. So we've managed to clean up a whole bunch of disc space there.</p> <p>A couple of things to note when deleting work directories, if you symlink stuff to your results directory, those symlink sources will now be deleted and your results will be gone forever. So that's why using copy mode is a safer thing to do, and generally what we recommend.</p> <p>Secondly, Nextflow's resume functionality relies on these work directories. So if you delete them and you run Nextflow again, the resume functionality will no longer work. So it's up to you to keep track of which things you may need or may not need, and only delete things when you're sure that it's safe to do so.</p> <p>The other thing we can do is we can just delete the entire work directory if we've finished our workflow run and we're sure we don't need it anymore.</p> <p>So I can do \"rm -r work\". I know there was nothing important in there. I've got my results that I care about in the results directory where we copied them. And so it was safe to delete the work directory.

What we're going to do is three things. We're going to add a new input to the process. We're going to tell the process script how to use that input, and then we're going to wire it up in the workflow so that we can use it dynamically with a command line flag when running Nextflow.</p> <p>So first things first. Let's add an input block here. Just the same as output. This is a new section for the process, and I'm going to say, \"val greeting\".</p> <p>Note here, I'm saying \"val\", which says that this is a variable, not a path.</p> <p>I can then go down into the script and then I can take out this hardcoded text here and do $greeting.

I could write \"Hello World\" and provide that string input to the process. But again, that wouldn't really solve any problems. We'd still have to go back and edit the pipeline code every time we wanted to change something, which is no good.</p> <p>The good news is that Nextflow has a built in system to handle command line arguments called parameters. So instead, I can use one of these special variables called paras and I can call it whatever I want, but I'm going to say greeting so that it matches the workflow logic.</p> <p>Hit save and let's see what we can do with this.</p> <p>So if I go back to the terminal. So we do \"nextflow run hello-world.nf\". Just as before, but the key difference is we do --greeting</p> <p>Note, there are two dashes here because this is a parameter. When we resumed the workflow before, that was a single dash . That's because resume is a core Nextflow option, and this is a parameter which is specific to our pipeline.</p> <p>Don't mix the two up. It's easy to do that. If you did --resume instead of just one dash, then that would be \"params.resume\", which wouldn't do anything. Likewise, if you did a single dash here, Nextflow wouldn't recognize it as a key argument.</p> <p>So it's --greeting, which corresponds to parameters greeting.</p> <p>I can now follow that with whatever text I want. So I'm in Sweden at the moment, so I'm going to say, \"Hej v\u00e4rlden\".</p> <p>So let's run it, see what happens, moment of truth.</p> <p>Okay, so you can see that the process ran again, just as before, sayHello with a single execution.</p> <p>This will have overwritten the file that was in the publishDir \"results\" directory.

So let's put a string here and let's say \"Hol\u00e0 mundo!\"</p> <p>Now this parameter has got a default defined, which will be used here , or we can still override it on the command line with --greeting, just as we did before.</p> <p>So let's check it works. \"nextflow run hello-world.nf\"</p> <p>No command-line arguments this time, and check whether it did the right thing.</p> <p>\"code results/output.txt\".

We can now go through all these different outputs from the view statements. Before split CSV, we had a single path. After split CSV, we had the single value arrays, and then after map, we have just the values without any array syntax. Let's go up to the results directory, and here are our output files behaving exactly as we wanted them to.</p> <p>There's a little bonus here. You can actually see that the view operators are slightly mixed up in the order that they've done the output. This is because Nextflow is doing parallelization of these different tasks. So after it split the CSV, there are three elements in this channel, and it's handling the processing of those three elements in parallel automatically. That means that the order of the outputs is stochastic and can vary. In this case, it just happened that some of the view operators returned after the subsequent step had been completed, and so it came in this order.</p> <p>If I run the same workflow again. Then sure enough, it's come in a different order and this time we've got the split CSVs and the maps in the order we'd expect.</p> <p>So just bear in mind, you cannot rely on the order of outputs from a process task because Nextflow's handling this parallelization for you automatically. Nextflow does that for you with its data flow logic, and that's the real power of Nextflow.</p> <p>Okay, this is probably one of the most important chapters of the whole training. Once you understand channels, channel factories and operators, you start to key into the strength of Nextflow and what makes it unique as a programming language. This functionality allows Nextflow to parallelize all of your workflows for you and generate extremely complex workflow logic with a very clean syntax and a push data flow model. It can be a bit of a strange concept at first, but once you get used to writing code like this, it will quickly feel natural and before you know it, you'll be writing fantastic workflows.</p> <p>Have a break, cup of tea, walk around and let's move on to chapter three, where we start to extend these concepts into more complex workflows.

And sure enough, you can see the first process used, the cache outputs, and the second output ran three of three. You can also see that we have both of our processes here now, our first process, say hello, run three times, and our second process convert to upper run three times.</p> <p>If I run this again, as a reminder, with -ansi-log false, we should see that six different process tasks run three for each of them. So this is doing exactly what we hoped it would. The first process is running three times, passing those outputs onto a second process, which is then running three times.</p> <p>So let's have a look inside the work directory and see how Nextflow is handling these file inputs. If I take this hash directory here from the second process we can use a tree command again with -a just to look at these files. You can see in here that we have our input file, which is the Bonjour-output.txt file, and that's actually a symlink. That's what this arrow is showing us, and it's pointing to the file in the previous work directory.</p> <p>This makes sense. Nextflow handles the execution of each task in its own encapsulated directory, so it's completely self enclosed. However, it needs to provide the files from a previous steps as an input. Rather than reaching outside of the work directory to get those files, Nextflow stages them into the work directory.</p> <p>If we have a shared file system like here, it does that using a symlink so that it doesn't use any additional file space. If we use cloud storage with buckets in different locations, it would fetch those files and actually copy them into the work directory.</p> <p>Let's have a look at the command sh file. If I do code work, command sh, you can see, sure enough, it's accessing that file from the local directory. So everything is very self-contained and clean.</p> <p>We can also check the results directory and make sure that these files were outputted properly. And sure enough, in results, we can see all the output files from the first process and all the output files from the second. And they're all in uppercase as we hoped.</p> <p>This is where the power of Nextflow starts to shine. With some very minimal code and Nextflow handled execution in parallel of these tasks with clean encapsulation within separate work directories and staging input and output files and file publishing all automatically for us just out of the box.

What we're going to do is take our one workflow script and break it up into separate files.</p> <p>This makes the code easier to navigate and maintain as your workflow gets bigger, and also makes it possible to share modules between pipelines so that if you have multiple pipelines using the same tool, you only need to write that process once.</p> <p>A classic example of this is the nf-core modules repository, which has thousands of different tools in ready to go modules, which you can install and use in your workflow.</p> <p>Nextflow can also work with sub workflows, which are like modules, but they have multiple processes.

If you're very used to docker or singularity or other container techs, then treat this as a refresher , or feel free to skip over it completely.</p> <p>Nextflow supports many different types of container technologies. That includes Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, and more.</p> <p>In this training, we're going to be focusing on Docker. That comes pre-installed in the code spaces and is one of the most popular container technologies, especially if you're developing on your own computer or your own laptop.</p> <p>If you're working in an academic environment on a shared HPC, you might find that Singularity is available and not Docker. That's fine. All of the concepts are exactly the same. A few of the manual commands are different, but if you understand Docker, you'll also understand singularity.</p> <p>In fact, Singularity is also installed in the Code Spaces environment. So if you like, you can try and do the same tasks using Singularity instead of Docker.</p> <p>Okay, so what is container technology? The idea behind Docker is that it can fetch an image from a remote source. Pull it to your local machine and then create a container based on that image.</p> <p>This running container is a little bit like a virtual machine running on your computer. It's isolated from your environment, and it comes prepackaged with an operating system and a set of available software.</p>"},{"location":"hello_nextflow/transcripts/05_hello_containers/#11-pull-the-container-image","title":"1.1.

If I was going to do that, I'd go into the module cowpy and change this container to use the singularity image like I showed in the previous chapter, with an oras://, which you can also get from Seqera Containers.</p> <p>I'd then go to Nextflow dot config set Docker enabled to false and do singularity enabled equals true. Or, if using Apptainer, apptainer enabled equals true and that would work.</p> <p>Nextflow, it does support other technologies as well apart from containers though, something you might be familiar with is conda. Here we can do conda enabled equals true and set Docker to false. conda doesn't use the same container directive. Instead, we can add a new one here called conda. We then specify the conda package we want to use. It's good practice to be as specific as possible to try and make the pipeline as reproducible as possible. So I'm going to specify the conda channel, conda- forge, and then cowpy, and the exact version, which was 1.1.5.</p> <p>I could also just write cowpy if I wanted, but that might resolve to a different version of cowpy on different executions of the pipeline.</p> <p>The nice thing about this is that I haven't touched the docker directive at all. This Docker image is still there. I'm just providing two alternatives now, and these can be switched on or off by using a config file alone.</p>"},{"location":"hello_nextflow/transcripts/06_hello_config/#13-run-the-workflow-to-verify-that-it-can-use-conda","title":"1.3.

However, it's cached this environment, so if I run the same Nextflow command again, it should be a lot quicker because it will reuse the same conda environment.</p> <p>One of the cool things about this is that these directives can be specified at process level, not just the entire workflow.

We have a box plot showing the variation of the resources that we used for each process.</p> <p>If I scroll down a bit further, I see similar information about memory used and job duration. Also disk read write.</p> <p>You can imagine for a large pipeline with long running tasks, this can be very informative about how to fine tune the configuration of the resources which you're requesting so that you don't over request, but also so that you can provide enough that it runs quickly.</p> <p>If I keep scrolling down the report, we also see a task table, which shows us detailed information about every single task that was run in the workflow.

We saw that we really didn't need much for our workflow, so let's tell Nextflow that we only need one gigabyte of memory for every process in the workflow.</p> <p>Now when we define it like this at process level, this is applied to every single process in the pipeline.</p>"},{"location":"hello_nextflow/transcripts/06_hello_config/#23-set-resource-allocations-for-an-individual-process","title":"2.3.

So it overrides it. And just for any processes which are called cowpy, will get two gigs of memory and two CPUs.</p> <p>Note that Nextflow is clever about resource utilization.

But you can imagine how this iterative approach of defining limits and doing real life workflows with this kind of reporting allows you to do an evidence-based approach to setting appropriate configuration and really making the most of the computational resources that you have available to you.</p> <p>You can start to be really clever about this. Nextflow has a built-in ability to retry failures, and you can take advantage in your config file by using a closure like this and dynamically setting the resources which are made available. So here I've told Nextflow to multiply that two gigabyte by the retry attempt. So the second retry will get four gigs, the third retry will get six gigs and so on. This is a bit beyond the scope of this training course, but if you're interested, check out the Nextflow docs, which has a nice section about dynamic retry logic.</p>"},{"location":"hello_nextflow/transcripts/06_hello_config/#25-add-resource-limits","title":"2.5. Add resource limits","text":"<p>Now, one thing you might notice about this is this kind of thing may make it quite easy to accidentally go beyond the resources available on your system. If you request more resources than are available Nextflow will throw an error about your configuration and halt the run. To avoid that, you can use something called resource limits.</p> <p>Under process scope, in our workflow, we can define resource limits like this, which takes an array, and we can specify the maximum memory CPUs and time which are available on this system.</p> <p>Setting high values here doesn't increase the amount of resources which are requested. We're still going to be using one gigabyte in our requests, but it means that if any of these requests get to 750, they'll hit that ceiling and nothing more than that will be requested, which means that Nextflow will continue to run and won't crash because of unavailable resources.</p> <p>So this is a nice safeguard to use, especially if you're using dynamic logic with your resource allocation.</p> <p>The other situation where this is really useful is if you're using pipelines which are public and not controlled by you. They might come with configuration defaults, and Nextflow will automatically take the right approach of thresholding any resource requests to run on your system.</p> <p>Okay, great.

Use a parameter file to store workflow parameters","text":"<p>Okay, next we're going to turn our attention to parameters. We can define parameters in the config file just as we did before in the Nextflow script. So params dot greeting equals hello or or use params scope and set foo equals bar.</p> <p>And that's great for setting defaults for your workflow. However, when you're running pipelines, it can be nice to specify parameters in a JSON or a YAML file.</p> <p>Using a file like this is much better than specifying command line options with dash dash. As when you run a workflow, you might have to specify many parameters and it can be tedious to write them all on a single CLI and error prone. Also, it is unlikely that you'll remember all the parameters that you used, so if you code that into a file, it's easier to launch the workflow again, using the same parameters in the future.</p> <p>We've got an example file here called test params, and you can see this specifies the three parameters we've got in our workflow with three different values. Personally, I find YAML easier to write than JSON. So just to demonstrate that it works, I'm going to create a new file called Test yaml and copy these in, get rid of the quotes.

Under this part of the training, we can see a few different examples of how different executors, in this case, HPC schedulers, define the resource requirements needed to submit a job.</p> <p>So for Slurm, you have these SBATCH headers, which define dash dash mem and the CPU number.

We can indicate this in the schema file directly by using the meta field:</p> Sample column<pre><code>    \"sample\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"pattern\": \"^\\\\S+$\",\n        \"errorMessage\": \"Sample name must be provided and cannot contain spaces\",\n        \"meta\": [\"id\"]\n    },\n</code></pre> <p>This sets the key name as <code>id</code> and the value that is in the <code>sample</code> column, for example <code>SAMPLE1_PE</code>:</p> meta map<pre><code>[id: SAMPLE1_PE]\n</code></pre> <p>By adding a new entry into the JSON schema, we can attach additional meta information that we want to track. This will automatically validate it for us and add it to the meta map.</p> <p>Let's add some new meta information, like the <code>sequencer</code> as an optional column:</p> assets/schema_input.json<pre><code>\"properties\": {\n    \"sample\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"pattern\": \"^\\\\S+$\",\n        \"errorMessage\": \"Sample name must be provided and cannot contain spaces\",\n        \"meta\": [\"id\"]\n    },\n    \"sequencer\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"pattern\": \"^\\\\S+$\",\n        \"meta\": [\"sequencer\"]\n    },\n    \"fastq_1\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"file-path\",\n        \"exists\": true,\n        \"pattern\": \"^\\\\S+\\\\.f(ast)?q\\\\.gz$\",\n        \"errorMessage\": \"FastQ file for reads 1 must be provided, cannot contain spaces and must have extension '.fq.gz' or '.fastq.gz'\"\n    },\n    \"fastq_2\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"file-path\",\n        \"exists\": true,\n        \"pattern\": \"^\\\\S+\\\\.f(ast)?q\\\\.gz$\",\n        \"errorMessage\": \"FastQ file for reads 2 cannot contain spaces and must have extension '.fq.gz' or '.fastq.gz'\"\n    }\n},\n\"required\": [\"sample\", \"fastq_1\"]\n</code></pre> <p>We can now run our normal tests with the old samplesheet:</p> <pre><code>nextflow run . -profile docker,test --outdir results\n</code></pre> <p>The meta map now has a new key <code>sequencer</code>, that is empty because we did not specify a value yet:</p> output<pre><code>[['id':'SAMPLE1_PE', 'sequencer':[], 'single_end':false], ... ]\n[['id':'SAMPLE2_PE', 'sequencer':[], 'single_end':false], ... ]\n[['id':'SAMPLE3_SE', 'sequencer':[], 'single_end':true], ... ]\n</code></pre> <p>We have also prepared a new samplesheet, that has the <code>sequencer</code> column.

If you're developing a workflow, one of the first things you will do is grab some test data that you know is valid and should produce a result. You add the first process to the pipeline and wire it up to your inputs to make it work. Then, to check it's all working, so you run it on the test data. Assuming that works, you move on to the next process and run the test data again. You repeat this process until you have a pipeline that you're happy with.</p> <p>Then, maybe you add a simple true or false parameter such as <code>--skip_process</code>. Now you must run the pipeline twice, once with each parameter to make sure it works as expected. But wait, how do we check if the <code>--skip_process</code> actually skips the process? We have to dig into the outputs or check the log files! This is a pain and prone to error.</p> <p>As you develop your pipeline, it will quickly become so complex that manually testing every iteration is slow and error prone. Furthermore, if you do find an error it will be very difficult to pin down exactly where in your pipeline the error is coming from. This is where testing comes in.</p> <p>Testing allows you to systematically check that every part of your pipeline is working as expected. The benefits to a developer of well written tests are huge:</p> <ul> <li>Confidence: Because the tests cover the entire pipeline, you can be be confident changing something doesn't affect anything else</li> <li>Trust: When multiple developers work on the pipeline, they know the other developers haven't broken the pipeline and every component.</li> <li>Transparency: The tests show where a pipeline is failing and make it easier to track down the problem. They also function as a form of documentation, showing how to run a process or workflow.</li> <li>Speed: Because the tests are automated, they can be run very quickly and repeatedly. You can iterate quickly with less fear of introducing new bugs.</li> </ul> <p>There are lots of different types of tests we can write:</p> <ol> <li>Module-level tests: For individual processes</li> <li>Workflow-level tests: For a single workflow</li> <li>Pipeline-level tests: For the pipeline as a whole</li> <li>Performance tests: For the speed and efficiency of the pipeline</li> <li>Stress tests: Assessing the pipeline's performance under extreme conditions to determine its limits</li> </ol> <p>Testing individual processes is analogous to unit tests in other languages. Testing the workflow or the entire pipeline is analogous to what's called integration tests in other languages, where we test the interactions of the components.</p> <p>nf-test is a tool that allows you to write module, workflow and pipeline level test. In short, it allows you to systematically check every individual part of the pipeline is working as expected, in isolation.</p> <p>In this part of the training, we're going to show you how to use nf-test to write module-level tests for the three processes in our pipeline.</p>"},{"location":"side_quests/nf-test/#0-warmup","title":"0.

One of the most useful things you can do is split your data into different streams and then group related items back together. This capability is particularly valuable in bioinformatics workflows where you often need to process different sample types separately before combining results for comparison or joint analysis.</p> <p>Think of it like sorting mail: you might first separate letters by their destination, process each pile differently, and then recombine items going to the same person. In Nextflow, we use special operators to do this with our scientific data.</p> <p>Nextflow's channel system is at the heart of this flexibility. Channels connect different parts of your workflow, allowing data to flow through your analysis. You can create multiple channels from a single data source, process each channel differently, and then merge channels back together when needed. This approach lets you design workflows that naturally mirror the branching and converging paths of complex bioinformatics analyses.</p> <p>In this side quest, we'll explore how to split and group data using Nextflow's powerful channel operators. We'll start with a samplesheet containing information about different samples and their associated data. By the end of this side quest, you'll be able to manipulate and combine data streams effectively, making your workflows more efficient and easier to understand.</p> <p>You will:</p> <ul> <li>Read data from files using <code>splitCsv</code></li> <li>Filter and transform data with <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code></li> <li>Combine related data using <code>join</code> and <code>groupTuple</code></li> </ul> <p>These skills will help you build workflows that can handle multiple samples and different types of data efficiently.</p>"},{"location":"side_quests/splitting_and_grouping/#0-warmup","title":"0.

Here's what we've accomplished:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Created Modular Workflows: We built two independent workflow modules:</p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>GREETING_WORKFLOW</code> that validates names, creates greetings, and adds timestamps</p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>TRANSFORM_WORKFLOW</code> that converts text to uppercase and reverses it</p> </li> <li> <p>Composed Workflows Together: We connected these workflows in a main pipeline, demonstrating how data can flow from one workflow to another.</p> </li> <li> <p>Used Workflow Interfaces: We defined clear inputs and outputs for each workflow using the <code>take:</code> and <code>emit:</code> syntax, creating well-defined interfaces between components.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managed Data Flow: We learned how to access workflow outputs using the namespace notation (<code>WORKFLOW_NAME.out.channel_name</code>) and pass them to other workflows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Practiced Modular Design: We experienced firsthand how breaking a pipeline into logical components makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Worked with Entry Points: We learned that Nextflow requires an entry workflow (either unnamed or specified with <code>-entry</code>) to know where to start execution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Structured Workflow Content: We wrapped workflow logic within the <code>main:</code> block.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This modular approach offers several advantages over monolithic pipelines:</p> <ul> <li>Each workflow can be developed, tested, and debugged independently</li> <li>Workflows can be reused across different pipelines</li> <li>The overall pipeline structure becomes more readable and maintainable</li> <li>Changes to one workflow don't necessarily affect others if the interfaces remain consistent</li> <li>Entry points can be configured to run different parts of your pipeline as needed</li> </ul> <p>It's important to note that while calling workflows is a bit like calling processes, it's not the same. You can't, for example, run a workflow n times by calling it with a channel of size n - you would need to pass a channel of size n to the workflow and iterate internally.</p> <p>By mastering workflow composition, you're now equipped to build more sophisticated Nextflow pipelines that can handle complex bioinformatics tasks while remaining maintainable and scalable.</p>"},{"location":"side_quests/workflows_of_workflows/#key-concepts","title":"Key Concepts","text":"<ol> <li>Workflow Inclusion</li> </ol> <pre><code>// Include a single workflow\ninclude { WORKFLOW_NAME } from './path/to/workflow'\n\n// Include multiple workflows\ninclude { WORKFLOW_A; WORKFLOW_B } from './path/to/workflows'\n\n// Include with alias to avoid name conflicts\ninclude { WORKFLOW_A as WORKFLOW_A_ALIAS } from './path/to/workflow'\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Workflow Inputs and Outputs</li> </ol> <pre><code>workflow EXAMPLE {\n    take:\n        input_ch    // Declare inputs\n    emit:\n        output_ch   // Declare outputs\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Main Block Structure</li> </ol> <pre><code>workflow EXAMPLE_WORKFLOW {\n    take:\n        // Input channels are declared here\n        input_ch\n\n    main:\n        // Workflow logic goes here\n        // This is where processes are called and channels are manipulated\n        result_ch = SOME_PROCESS(input_ch)\n\n    emit:\n        // Output channels are declared here\n        output_ch = result_ch\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Workflow Composition</li> </ol> <pre><code>// Using explicit connections\nWORKFLOW_A(input_ch)\nWORKFLOW_B(WORKFLOW_A.out.some_channel)\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Entry Points</li> </ol> <pre><code>// Unnamed workflow (default entry point)\nworkflow {\n    // This is automatically the entry point when the script is run\n}\n\n// Named workflow (not an entry point by default)\nworkflow NAMED_WORKFLOW {\n    // This is not automatically run\n}\n\n// Running a named workflow as entry point\n// nextflow run script.nf -entry NAMED_WORKFLOW\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"side_quests/workflows_of_workflows/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Nextflow Workflow Documentation</li> <li>Channel Operators Reference</li> <li>Error Strategy Documentation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"pt/","title":"Treinamentos Nextflow","text":"<p>Seja bem vindo ao portal de treinamentos da comunidade do Nextflow!</p> <p>Temos v\u00e1rios treinamentos distintos dispon\u00edveis neste site.

Cet objet peut ensuite \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour associer des \u00e9chantillons provenant de canaux distincts en vue d'une utilisation en aval. Par exemple, au lieu de mettre juste <code>/some/path/myoutput.bam</code> dans un canal, vous pouvez utiliser <code>['SRR123', '/some/path/myoutput.bam']</code> pour vous assurer que les processus ne sont pas en conflit. Regardez l'exemple ci-dessous :</p> <pre><code>// For example purposes only.\n// These would normally be outputs from upstream processes.\nChannel\n    .of(\n        [[id: 'sample_1'], '/path/to/sample_1.bam'],\n        [[id: 'sample_2'], '/path/to/sample_2.bam']\n    )\n    .set { bam }\n\n// NB: sample_2 is now the first element, instead of sample_1\nChannel\n    .of(\n        [[id: 'sample_2'], '/path/to/sample_2.bai'],\n        [[id: 'sample_1'], '/path/to/sample_1.bai']\n    )\n    .set { bai }\n\n// Instead of feeding the downstream process with these two channels separately, we can\n// join them and provide a single channel where the sample meta map is implicitly matched:\nbam\n    .join(bai)\n    | PROCESS_C\n</code></pre> <p>Si les m\u00e9ta-cartes ne sont pas possibles, une alternative est d'utiliser la directive de processus <code>fair</code>. Lorsque cette directive est sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e, Nextflow garantira que l'ordre des sorties correspondra \u00e0 l'ordre des entr\u00e9es. Il est important de mentionner que l'ordre dans lequel les t\u00e2ches seront termin\u00e9es ne suivra pas n\u00e9cessairement l'ordre dans le canal d'entr\u00e9e, mais Nextflow garantit qu'\u00e0 la fin de celui-ci, le canal de sortie contiendra les \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans l'ordre respectif.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>En fonction de votre situation, l'utilisation de la directive <code>fair</code> peut entra\u00eener une diminution des performances.</p>"},{"location":"fr/basic_training/debugging/","title":"Debugging","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Some of the translations on the training portal are out of date.
