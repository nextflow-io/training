# Validate Training Materials

Run comprehensive validation checks on training materials. Execute from repository root.

See [../shared/repo-conventions.md](../shared/repo-conventions.md) for directory mapping and file conventions.

## Skill Dependencies (MANDATORY)

This skill MUST invoke other skills during validation. **Do not skip these.**

| Task | Skill | When |
|------|-------|------|
| Check code block highlights | `/check-highlights` | Always |
| Check inline code formatting | `/check-inline-code` | Always |

## Scope

Ask user to specify what to validate if not clear:
- Specific side quest (e.g., "debugging")
- Specific module (e.g., "hello_nextflow")
- Entire repository (only if explicitly requested)

## Determining Scope

Based on the user's request, determine the scope:

1. **Specific side quest** (e.g., "debugging"):

   - Documentation file: `docs/side_quests/{name}.md`
   - Example scripts: `side-quests/{name}/**/*.nf`
   - Solution files: `side-quests/solutions/{name}/**/*.nf`

2. **Specific module** (e.g., "hello_nextflow"):

   - Documentation files: `docs/{module}/**/*.md`
   - Example scripts: `{module}/**/*.nf` or `nf-training/**/*.nf`
   - Solution files: `{module}/solutions/**/*.nf`

3. **Entire repository** (only if explicitly requested):
   - All files: `docs/**/*.md`, `**/*.nf`

## Tasks to Perform

Perform the following checks **only on files within the determined scope**:

1. **Check Heading Numbering**

   - Run: `uv run .github/check_headings.py [scoped-path]/**/*.md`
   - Report any heading numbering issues found
   - If errors exist, ask if user wants to auto-fix with `--fix` flag

2. **Find TODO/FIXME Comments**

   - Search markdown files in scope
   - Search Nextflow scripts in scope
   - Categorize by priority (high, medium, low)
   - Report files with most TODOs

3. **Check Nextflow Script Conventions**

   - Find .nf files in scope
   - Verify they start with `#!/usr/bin/env nextflow`
   - Check for DSL2 syntax
   - Report any that don't follow conventions

4. **Find Orphaned Files**

   - Check if main documentation file is referenced in mkdocs.yml
   - Look for solution files without corresponding exercise documentation
   - Report any orphaned files within scope

5. **Verify Admonition Syntax**

   - Search for common admonition formatting errors in scoped files
   - Check for proper indentation (4 spaces)
   - Report any malformed admonitions

6. **Check Code Block Highlights**

   ```
   >>> STOP. INVOKE /check-highlights on the scoped files NOW.

   Record results before continuing.
   ```

7. **Check Inline Code Formatting**

   ```
   >>> STOP. INVOKE /check-inline-code on the scoped files NOW.

   Record results before continuing.
   ```

8. **Check Writing Style**

   - Search for LLM-style patterns that should be avoided:
     - `Let's` or `let's` at start of sentences
     - `Remember when` or `Remember that` callbacks
     - `Don't worry` reassurances
     - `worth mentioning` or `important to note` padding
     - Exclamation marks used for emphasis (not in code/output)
   - Check for em-dash elaborations (space-hyphen-space followed by lowercase) that could be periods
   - Flag any issues found for manual review

9. **Deep Lesson Review** (when reviewing a specific lesson file)

   If the user asks to review a specific lesson, perform this comprehensive checklist:

   a. **Structure Check**:

   - [ ] Proper heading numbering with trailing periods
   - [ ] Heading levels match numbering depth (## for 1., ### for 1.1.)
   - [ ] Each major section has "### Takeaway"
   - [ ] Each major section has "### What's next?"
   - [ ] Logical flow from simple to complex
   - [ ] Clear learning objectives stated or implied

   b. **Formatting Check**:

   - [ ] Code blocks have proper titles, line numbers, and highlighting
   - [ ] Console output properly formatted with `console title="Output"`
   - [ ] File paths use proper markdown formatting
   - [ ] Before/After comparisons use tabbed blocks
   - [ ] Admonitions properly formatted and indented
   - [ ] Each sentence on new line (for clean diffs)

   c. **Content Check**:

   - [ ] Technical accuracy of Nextflow code
   - [ ] Commands are correct and runnable
   - [ ] Parameter syntax correct (-- for pipeline, - for Nextflow)
   - [ ] Examples progress logically
   - [ ] Common pitfalls addressed
   - [ ] Edge cases explained

   d. **Teaching Effectiveness**:

   - [ ] Clear explanations for beginners
   - [ ] Concepts introduced before use
   - [ ] Examples are relevant and motivating
   - [ ] Exercises appropriate for skill level
   - [ ] Solutions available for exercises
   - [ ] Good use of tips and warnings

   e. **Cross-References**:

   - [ ] Links to related lessons work
   - [ ] References to files/scripts are correct
   - [ ] External links are valid
   - [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated

   f. **Examples & Code**:

   - [ ] All Nextflow examples are syntactically correct
   - [ ] Variable names are clear and consistent
   - [ ] Comments explain non-obvious code
   - [ ] Examples can be run as shown
   - [ ] Output examples match what code produces

   g. **Writing Style** (see CLAUDE.md for full guidelines):

   - [ ] No LLM-style interjections ("Let's", "Remember when...?", "Don't worry")
   - [ ] No exclamation-based emphasis ("Much faster!", "So powerful!")
   - [ ] Em-dash elaborations replaced with periods or semicolons
   - [ ] List explanations use colons, not hyphens
   - [ ] Single clear explanation per concept (not multiple phrasings)
   - [ ] Professional, direct tone throughout

## Output Format

Structure your report with these sections:

```
# Validation Report

## Heading Numbering
## TODO/FIXME Comments (count by priority, list top files)
## Nextflow Scripts (conventions check)
## Orphaned Files
## Admonitions
## Code Block Highlights (from /check-highlights)
## Inline Code Formatting (from /check-inline-code)
## Writing Style
## Summary
```

For deep lesson reviews, add sections for: Structure, Formatting, Content Accuracy, Teaching Effectiveness, Cross-References, Examples & Code, Writing Style, Overall Assessment, Positive Aspects.

**Important**: Always provide actionable next steps for any issues found. If no issues found, give clear confirmation.
