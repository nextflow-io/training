# Validate Training Materials

Run comprehensive validation checks on training materials to ensure quality and consistency. This includes both automated checks and deep lesson reviews.

## User Input

**IMPORTANT**: Ask the user to specify what to validate if not clear from the request:

- A specific side quest (e.g., "debugging", "metadata")
- A specific module (e.g., "hello_nextflow", "nf4_science/genomics")
- The entire repository (only if explicitly requested)

If the user provides a path or module name, **only validate that specific content**.

## Working Directory

**IMPORTANT**: All commands in this skill must be executed from the repository root directory.

- The repository root is the directory containing `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/`, and `.github/`
- Verify you are in the correct directory before running any commands (check for these files/folders)
- All file paths in this skill are relative to the repository root
- Do not change directories during skill execution
- Use paths relative to repository root only

## Determining Scope

Based on the user's request, determine the scope:

1. **Specific side quest** (e.g., "debugging"):
   - Documentation file: `docs/side_quests/{name}.md`
   - Example scripts: `side-quests/{name}/**/*.nf`
   - Solution files: `side-quests/solutions/{name}/**/*.nf`

2. **Specific module** (e.g., "hello_nextflow"):
   - Documentation files: `docs/{module}/**/*.md`
   - Example scripts: `{module}/**/*.nf` or `nf-training/**/*.nf`
   - Solution files: `{module}/solutions/**/*.nf`

3. **Entire repository** (only if explicitly requested):
   - All files: `docs/**/*.md`, `**/*.nf`

## Tasks to Perform

Perform the following checks **only on files within the determined scope**:

1. **Check Heading Numbering**

   - Run: `uv run .github/check_headings.py [scoped-path]/**/*.md`
   - Report any heading numbering issues found
   - If errors exist, ask if user wants to auto-fix with `--fix` flag

2. **Find TODO/FIXME Comments**

   - Search markdown files in scope
   - Search Nextflow scripts in scope
   - Categorize by priority (high, medium, low)
   - Report files with most TODOs

3. **Check Nextflow Script Conventions**

   - Find .nf files in scope
   - Verify they start with `#!/usr/bin/env nextflow`
   - Check for DSL2 syntax
   - Report any that don't follow conventions

4. **Find Orphaned Files**

   - Check if main documentation file is referenced in mkdocs.yml
   - Look for solution files without corresponding exercise documentation
   - Report any orphaned files within scope

5. **Verify Admonition Syntax**
   - Search for common admonition formatting errors in scoped files
   - Check for proper indentation (4 spaces)
   - Report any malformed admonitions

6. **Deep Lesson Review** (when reviewing a specific lesson file)

   If the user asks to review a specific lesson, perform this comprehensive checklist:

   a. **Structure Check**:
      - [ ] Proper heading numbering with trailing periods
      - [ ] Heading levels match numbering depth (## for 1., ### for 1.1.)
      - [ ] Each major section has "### Takeaway"
      - [ ] Each major section has "### What's next?"
      - [ ] Logical flow from simple to complex
      - [ ] Clear learning objectives stated or implied

   b. **Formatting Check**:
      - [ ] Code blocks have proper titles, line numbers, and highlighting
      - [ ] Console output properly formatted with `console title="Output"`
      - [ ] File paths use proper markdown formatting
      - [ ] Before/After comparisons use tabbed blocks
      - [ ] Admonitions properly formatted and indented
      - [ ] Each sentence on new line (for clean diffs)

   c. **Content Check**:
      - [ ] Technical accuracy of Nextflow code
      - [ ] Commands are correct and runnable
      - [ ] Parameter syntax correct (-- for pipeline, - for Nextflow)
      - [ ] Examples progress logically
      - [ ] Common pitfalls addressed
      - [ ] Edge cases explained

   d. **Teaching Effectiveness**:
      - [ ] Clear explanations for beginners
      - [ ] Concepts introduced before use
      - [ ] Examples are relevant and motivating
      - [ ] Exercises appropriate for skill level
      - [ ] Solutions available for exercises
      - [ ] Good use of tips and warnings

   e. **Cross-References**:
      - [ ] Links to related lessons work
      - [ ] References to files/scripts are correct
      - [ ] External links are valid
      - [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated

   f. **Examples & Code**:
      - [ ] All Nextflow examples are syntactically correct
      - [ ] Variable names are clear and consistent
      - [ ] Comments explain non-obvious code
      - [ ] Examples can be run as shown
      - [ ] Output examples match what code produces

## Output Format

Provide a structured report. For automated validation checks:

```
# Validation Report
