   - [ ] Each major section has "### What's next?"
   - [ ] Logical flow from simple to complex
   - [ ] Clear learning objectives stated or implied

3. **Formatting Check**:
   - [ ] Code blocks have proper titles, line numbers, and highlighting
   - [ ] Console output properly formatted with `console title="Output"`
   - [ ] File paths use proper markdown formatting
   - [ ] Before/After comparisons use tabbed blocks
   - [ ] Admonitions properly formatted and indented
   - [ ] Each sentence on new line (for clean diffs)

4. **Content Check**:
