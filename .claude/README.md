# Claude Configuration for Nextflow Training Materials

This directory contains Claude AI assistant configuration to help developers create and maintain Nextflow training materials.

## Files Overview

### `.clinerules`

Core rules and conventions for this repository. Claude automatically follows these guidelines for:

- Nextflow script development (DSL2, process naming, params)
- Markdown documentation formatting (heading numbering, admonitions, code blocks)
- Repository structure and organization
- Content style and best practices

### `commands/` Directory

Slash commands for interactive content creation tasks that use templates and require user input.

### `skills/` Directory

Skills for autonomous multi-step tasks like validation, testing, and analysis.

## Commands vs Skills: Design Rationale

### Commands (Interactive, Template-Based)

Commands are used for **content creation** tasks that:

- Follow a template or standard structure
- Need user questions/answers for customization
- Benefit from showing the full prompt/checklist to the user
- Are step-by-step guided workflows

### Skills (Autonomous, Multi-Step)

Skills are used for **validation and testing** tasks that:

- Require searching across multiple files
- Need to run commands and analyze outputs
- Make decisions based on what they find
- Can work independently without constant user input

## Available Commands

### `/new-module`

**Why a command**: Template-based scaffolding requiring user input about module name, location, and content.

Creates a complete training module with standard structure:

- index.md (overview)
- 00_orientation.md (prerequisites and intro)
- Numbered lesson files
- survey.md and next_steps.md
- solutions/ directory

### `/new-lesson`

**Why a command**: Guided workflow that asks questions and fills in a template structure.

Creates a new lesson page within an existing module with:

- Proper heading numbering (1., 1.1., etc.)
- Takeaway and What's next? sections
- Placeholder code blocks with proper formatting
- Standard structure

### `/add-exercise`

**Why a command**: Interactive insertion requiring decisions about placement, content, and difficulty level.

Adds an exercise with solution to an existing lesson:

- Uses `??? exercise` and `??? solution` admonitions
- Creates corresponding solution files if needed
- Proper formatting and structure

### `/preview`

**Why a command**: One-command convenience to start the preview server.

Starts the Docker-based MkDocs preview server:

- Runs the training-specific Docker image
- Serves on http://0.0.0.0:8000/
- Auto-refreshes on file changes

## Available Skills

### `validate`

**Why a skill**: Autonomous multi-step validation requiring searches, tool execution, and analysis.

Runs comprehensive validation and review checks:

- Heading numbering validation (runs check_headings.py)
- TODO/FIXME comment search and categorization
- Nextflow script convention checking
- Orphaned file detection
- Admonition syntax verification
- Deep lesson review (structure, formatting, content accuracy, teaching effectiveness)

Outputs structured report with actionable recommendations. Includes lesson review functionality.

### `test-example`

**Why a skill**: Complex autonomous task requiring script execution, output verification, and comparison with docs.

Tests a Nextflow script and verifies documentation accuracy:

- Runs the script and captures output
- Tests resume functionality
- Tests with different parameters
- Compares actual behavior with documented behavior
- Reports discrepancies and suggests fixes

### `find-todos`

**Why a skill**: Search and analysis task that works autonomously across the codebase.

Searches for TODO/FIXME comments:

- Markdown files, Nextflow scripts, config files
- Categorizes by priority (high, medium, low)
- Groups by file and provides context
- Recommends prioritization

## Quick Examples

**Create content:**

```
/new-lesson
/add-exercise
/new-module
```

**Preview locally:**

```
/preview
```

**Validate and review (skills - Claude invokes these automatically when relevant):**

Claude will automatically use these skills when appropriate, or you can mention them by name:

- "Can you validate the training materials?"
- "Please review this lesson for quality"
- "Test the example script"
- "Find all the TODOs in the codebase"

## Key Repository Conventions

### Markdown Files

- Each sentence on new line (cleaner git diffs)
- Numbered headings with trailing periods: `## 1. Section`, `### 1.1. Subsection`
- Takeaway and What's next? sections at end of major sections
- Use admonitions: `!!! note`, `!!! tip`, `!!! warning`, `??? exercise`, `??? solution`

### Nextflow Scripts

- DSL2 syntax only
- UPPERCASE process names
- Always include shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env nextflow`
- Use params for configurable values: `params.input = 'default'`

### Code Blocks

Include line numbers, titles, and highlighting:

```groovy title="example.nf" linenums="1" hl_lines="3"
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

params.greeting = 'Hello'  // highlighted
```

## Hooks

### User Prompt Submit Hook

Automatically runs heading validation when you submit a prompt:

- Executes: `uv run .github/check_headings.py docs/**/*.md`
- Provides immediate feedback on heading numbering issues
- Non-blocking (allows operation to continue even if issues found)

## Development Workflow

1. **Create/Edit Content**

   - Use `/new-lesson` or `/new-module` for structure
   - Follow conventions in `.clinerules`
   - Add exercises with `/add-exercise`

2. **Review Quality**

   - Ask Claude to validate and review: "Can you review this lesson?"
   - The validate skill runs automated checks and deep lesson reviews

3. **Test Examples**

   - Ask Claude to test scripts: "Can you test this Nextflow example?"
   - The test-example skill verifies scripts and compares with documentation

4. **Update Navigation**

   - Manually edit mkdocs.yml to add new content
   - Or just ask Claude to update it

5. **Preview Locally**

   - Run: `mkdocs serve` or use Docker (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - View at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

6. **Commit**
   - Heading validation runs automatically
   - Write clear commit message
   - Push to fork and open PR

## Additional Tools

Consider also using:

- **Vale**: Linting for docs (can be added as separate PR/hook)
- **Prettier**: Markdown formatting (install VSCode extension)
- **Todo Tree**: VSCode extension to track TODO comments
- **Excalidraw**: VSCode extension for editing diagrams
