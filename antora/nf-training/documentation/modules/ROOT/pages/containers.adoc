= Manage dependencies & containers

Computational workflows are rarely composed of a single script or tool.Â 
Most of the times they require the usage of dozens of different software
components or libraries.

Installing and maintaining such dependencies is a challenging task and
the most common source of irreproducibility in scientific applications.

To overcome these issues, we use containers, which allow the encapsulation of software dependencies, i.e. tools and libraries required by a data analysis application in one or more self-contained, ready-to-run, immutable Linux container images, that can be easily deployed in any platform supporting the container runtime.

Containers can be executed in an isolated manner from the hosting system. 
Having its own copy of the file system, processing space, memory management, etc.

NOTE: Containers were first introduced with kernel 2.6 as a Linux feature known as _Control Groups_ or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups[Cgroups].


== Docker

Docker is a handy management tool to build, run and share container images.

These images can be uploaded and published in a centralised repository know as
https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub], or hosted by other parties like https://quay.io[Quay].

=== Run a container

A container can be run using the following command:

```bash
docker run <container-name>
```

Try for example the following publically available container (if you have docker installed):

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

=== Pull a container

The pull command allows you to download a Docker image without running it. For example:

```bash
docker pull debian:stretch-slim
```

The above command download a Debian Linux image. You can check it exists by using:

```bash
docker images
```

=== Run a container in interactive mode

Launching a BASH shell in the container allows you to operate in an interactive mode
in the containerised operating system. For example:

```bash
docker run -it debian:stretch-slim bash
```

Once launched, you will notice that it is running as root (!).
Use the usual commands to navigate in the file system. 
This is useful to check if the expected programs are present within a container.

To exit from the container, stop the BASH session with the `exit` command.

=== Your first Dockerfile

Docker images are created by using a so-called `Dockerfile`, which is a simple text file
containing a list of commands to assemble and configure the image
with the software packages required.

In this step you will create a Docker image containing the Salmon tool.

IMPORTANT: the Docker build process automatically copies all files that are located in the
current directory to the Docker daemon in order to create the image. This can take
a lot of time when big/many files exists. For this reason it's important to _always_ work in
a directory containing only the files you really need to include in your Docker image.
Alternatively you can use the `.dockerignore` file to select the path to exclude from the build.

Then use your favourite editor (e.g. `vim` or `nano`) to create a file named `Dockerfile` and copy the
following content:

[source,docker,linenums]
----
FROM debian:stretch-slim

MAINTAINER <your name>

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl cowsay

ENV PATH=$PATH:/usr/games/
----

=== Build the image

Build the Dockerfile image by using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-image .
```

Where "my-image" is the user specified name tag for the Dockerfile, present in the current directory.

IMPORTANT: Don't miss the dot in the above command. When it completes, verify that the image
has been created listing all available images:

```bash
docker images
```

You can try your new container by running this command:

```bash
docker run my-image cowsay Hello Docker!
```

=== Add a software package to the image

Add the Salmon package to the Docker image by adding to the `Dockerfile` the following snippet:

[source,docker,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
RUN curl -sSL https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/download/v1.5.2/salmon-1.5.2_linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz \
 && mv /salmon-*/bin/* /usr/bin/ \
 && mv /salmon-*/lib/* /usr/lib/
----

Save the file and build the image again with the same command as before:

```bash
docker build -t my-image .
```

You will notice that it creates a new Docker image with the same name *but* with a
different image ID.

=== Run Salmon in the container

Check that Salmon is running correctly in the container as shown below:

```bash
docker run my-image salmon --version
```

You can even launch a container in an interactive mode by using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it my-image bash
```

Use the `exit` command to terminate the interactive session.


=== File system mounts

Create a genome index file by running Salmon in the container.

Try to run Salmon in the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run my-image \
  salmon index -t $PWD/data/ggal/transcriptome.fa -i transcript-index
```

The above command fails because Salmon cannot access the input file.

This happens because the container runs in a completely separate file system and
it cannot access the hosting file system by default.

You will need to use the `--volume` command line option to mount the input file(s) e.g.

```bash
docker run --volume $PWD/data/ggal/transcriptome.fa:/transcriptome.fa my-image \
  salmon index -t /transcriptome.fa -i transcript-index
```

IMPORTANT: the generated `transcript-index` directory is still not accessible in the host
file system.

TIP: An easier way is to mount a parent directory to an identical one in the container,
this allows you to use the same path when running it in the container e.g.

```bash
docker run --volume $PWD:$PWD --workdir $PWD my-image \
  salmon index -t $PWD/data/ggal/transcriptome.fa -i transcript-index
```

or set a folder you want to mount as an environmental variable, called `DATA`:

```
DATA=/workspace/nf-training-public/nf-training/data
docker run --volume $DATA:$DATA --workdir $PWD my-image \
  salmon index -t $PWD/data/ggal/transcriptome.fa -i transcript-index
```

Now check the content of the `transcript-index` folder entering the command:

```bash
ls -la transcript-index
```

IMPORTANT: Note that the permissions for files created by the Docker
execution is `root`.

[discrete]
=== Exercise

Use the option `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` to allow Docker to create files with the right permission.

=== Upload the container in the Docker Hub (bonus)

Publish your container in the Docker Hub to share it with other people.

Create an account in the https://hub.docker.com web site. Then from your shell terminal run
the following command, entering the user name and password you specified registering in the Hub:

```bash
docker login
```

Tag the image with your Docker user name account:

```bash
docker tag my-image <user-name>/my-image
```

Finally push it to the Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push <user-name>/my-image
```

After that anyone will be able to download it by using the command:

```bash
docker pull <user-name>/my-image
```

Note how after a pull and push operation, Docker prints the container digest number e.g.

```bash
Digest: sha256:aeacbd7ea1154f263cda972a96920fb228b2033544c2641476350b9317dab266
Status: Downloaded newer image for nextflow/rnaseq-nf:latest
```

This is a unique and immutable identifier that can be used to reference a container image
in a univocally manner. For example:

```bash
docker pull nextflow/rnaseq-nf@sha256:aeacbd7ea1154f263cda972a96920fb228b2033544c2641476350b9317dab266
```

=== Run a Nextflow script using a Docker container

The simplest way to run a Nextflow script with a Docker image is using the
`-with-docker` command line option:

```
nextflow run script2.nf -with-docker my-image
```

We'll see later how to configure in the Nextflow config file which container 
to use instead of having to specify every time as a command line argument.


== Singularity

http://singularity.lbl.gov[Singularity] is container runtime designed to work in HPC data center,
where the usage of Docker is generally not allowed due to security constraints.

Singularity implements a container execution model similar to Docker, however it uses
a complete different implementation design.

A Singularity container image is archived as a plain file that can be stored in a shared
file system and accessed by many computing nodes managed by a batch scheduler.

=== Create a Singularity images

Singularity images are created using a `Singularity` file in  similar manner to Docker,
though using a different syntax.

[source,singularity,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
Bootstrap: docker
From: debian:stretch-slim

%environment
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/games/

%labels
AUTHOR <your name>

%post

apt-get update && apt-get install -y locales-all curl cowsay
curl -sSL https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/download/v1.0.0/salmon-1.0.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz \
 && mv /salmon-*/bin/* /usr/bin/ \
 && mv /salmon-*/lib/* /usr/lib/
----

Once you have save the `Singularity` file. Create the image with these commands:

```bash
sudo singularity build my-image.sif Singularity
```

Note: the `build` command requires `sudo` permissions. A common workaround
consists to build the image on a local workstation and then deploy in the
cluster just copying the image file.

=== Running a container

Once done, you can run your container with the following command


```bash
singularity exec my-image.sif cowsay 'Hello Singularity'
```

By using the `shell` command you can enter in the container in interactive mode.
For example:

```bash
singularity shell my-image.sif
```

Once in the container instance run the following commands:

```bash
touch hello.txt
ls -la
```

TIP: Note how the files on the host environment are shown. Singularity automatically
mounts the host `$HOME` directory and uses the current work directory.

=== Import a Docker image

An easier way to create Singularity container without requiring sudo permission and
boosting the containers interoperability is to import a Docker container image
pulling it directly from a Docker registry. For example:

```bash
singularity pull docker://debian:stretch-slim
```

The above command automatically downloads the Debian Docker image and converts it to
a Singularity image store in the current directory with the name `debian-jessie.simg`.


=== Run a Nextflow script using a Singularity container

Nextflow allows the transparent usage of Singularity containers as easy as with
Docker ones.

It only requires to enable the use of Singularity engine in place of Docker in the
Nextflow configuration file using the `-with-singularity` command line option:

```bash
nextflow run script7.nf -with-singularity nextflow/rnaseq-nf
```

As before the Singularity container can also be provided in the Nextflow config file. 
We'll see later how to do it. 


=== The Singularity Container Library

The authors of Singularity, https://www.sylabs.io/[SyLabs] have their own repository of Singularity
containers.

In the same way that we can push docker images to Docker Hub, we can upload Singularity images
to the Singularity Library.


== Conda/Bioconda packages

Conda is a popular package and environment manager. The built-in support for Conda
allows Nextflow pipelines to automatically create and activate the Conda
environment(s), given the dependencies specified by each process.

For this Gitpod tutorial you need to activate conda by typing:


```bash
conda_activate 
```

You should now see that the beginning of your command prompt has `(base)` written. If you wish to deactivate conda at any point, simply enter `conda deactivate`.

=== Using conda

A Conda environment is defined using a YAML file, which lists the required software packages.
For example:

```yaml
name: nf-tutorial
channels:
  - defaults
  - bioconda
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - salmon=1.0.0
  - fastqc=0.11.5
  - multiqc=1.5
  - tbb=2020.2
```

Given the recipe file, the environment is created using the command shown below:

```bash
conda env create --file env.yml
```

You can check the environment was created successfully with the command shown below:

```bash
conda env list
```

This should look something like this:
```bash
# conda environments:
#
base                     /opt/conda
nf-tutorial           *  /opt/conda/envs/nf-tutorial
```

To enable the environment you can use the `activate` command:

```bash
conda activate nf-tutorial
```

Nextflow is able to manage the activation of a Conda environment when the its directory
is specified using the `-with-conda` option (using the same path shown in the `list` function. For example:

```bash
nextflow run script7.nf -with-conda /opt/conda/envs/nf-tutorial
```

TIP: When specifying as Conda environment a YAML recipe file, Nextflow automatically downloads the required dependencies, build the environment and automatically activate it.

This makes easier to manage different environments for the processes in the workflow script.

See the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html[docs] for details.


=== Create and use conda-like environments using micromamba

Another way to build conda-like environments is through a `Dockerfile` and https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html[`micromamba`]. 

`micromamba` is fast and robust package for building small conda-based environments.

This saves having to build a conda environment each time you want to use it (as outlined in previous sections).

To do this, you simply require a `Dockerfile`, such as the one in this public https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile-mamba[repo]:

```
FROM mambaorg/micromamba                                                                                    
MAINTAINER Your name <your_email>

RUN \
   micromamba install -y -n base -c defaults -c bioconda -c conda-forge \
      salmon=1.5.1 \
      fastqc=0.11.9 \
      multiqc=1.10.1 \
   && micromamba clean -a -y
```

The above `Dockerfile` takes the parent image 'mambaorg/micromamba', then installs a `conda` environment using `micromamba`, and installs `salmon`, `fastqc` and `multiqc`. 

[discrete]
=== Exercise

Try executing the RNA-Seq pipeline from earlier (script7.nf), but start by building your own micromamba `Dockerfile` (from above), save to your docker hub repo and direct Nextflow to run from this container (changing your `nexflow.config`). 

IMPORTANT: Building a Docker container and pushing to your personal repo can take >10 minutes.

.For an overview of steps to take, click here:
[%collapsible]
====
1. Make a file called `Dockerfile` in the current directory (with above code).

2. Build the image: `docker build -t my-image .` (don't forget the '.').

3. Publish the docker image to your online docker account. 
+
--
Something similar to the following, with <myrepo> replaced with your own Docker ID, without '<' and '>' characters!. 

TIP: "my-image" could be any name you choose. Just choose something memorable and ensure the name matches the name you used in the previous command.

```
docker login
docker tag my-image <myrepo>/my-image
docker push <myrepo>/my-image
```
--

4. Add the image file name to the nextflow.config file. 
+
--
e.g. remove the following from the nextflow.config:

```
process.container = 'nextflow/rnaseq-nf'
```

and replace with:

```
process.container = '<myrepo>/my-image'
```

replacing the above the correct docker hub link.
--

5. Trying running Nextflow, e.g.:
+
--
```
nextflow run script7.nf -with-docker
```
--

It should now work, and find `salmon` to run the process.

== BioContainers

Another useful resource linking together Bioconda and containers is the https://biocontainers.pro[BioContainers] project.
BioContainers is a community initiative that provides a registry of container images for every Bioconda recipe.
