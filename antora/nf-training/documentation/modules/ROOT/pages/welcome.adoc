We are excited to have you on the path to writing reproducible and scalable scientific workflows using Nextflow. This guide complements the full Nextflow documentation - if you ever have any doubts, head over to the docs located https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest[here].

By the end of this course you should:

1. Be proficient in writing Nextflow pipelines
2. Know the basic Nextflow concepts of Channels, Processes and Operators
3. Have an understanding of containerised workflows
4. Understand the different execution platforms supported by Nextflow 
5. Be introducted to the Nextflow community and ecosystem

== Overview

To get you started with Nextflow as quickly as possible, we will walk through the following steps:

1. Set up a development environment to run Nextflow. 

2. Explore Nexflow concepts using some basic workflows including a multistep RNA-Seq analysis. 

3. Build and use Docker containers to encaspusulate all workflow dependencies. 

4. Dive deeper into the core Nextflow syntax including Channels, Processes and Operators. 

5. Cover cluster and cloud deployment scenarios and explore Nextflow Tower capabilities. 

This will give you a broad understanding of Nextflow, so that you can start writing your own pipelines. We hope you enjoy the course! This is ever-evolving document and feedback is always welcome.
