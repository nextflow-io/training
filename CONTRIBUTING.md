## Contribution model

The typical workflow for contributing to training content is as follows:

1. Make a _fork_ of the GitHub repository to your own account
2. Develop locally (see below) and make your changes
3. Commit and push to your forked repository
4. Open a pull-request against the main repo, which can be reviewed and merged

The training website is built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
It's a static site generator designed for documentation websites which is fast and lightweight and comes with a lot of nice features.
We use the open-source version of the tool (not any of the "insiders" features, currently).

To make changes, you should run the website locally so that you can preview changes.

## Installation

See the [mkdocs material docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) for full installation instructions.
A short version for this training site is below.

### Docker

If you are used to using Docker and don't want to mess around with Python, you can run the following command to preview the site:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs ghcr.io/nextflow-io/training-mkdocs:latest
```

This uses a custom image with all required mkdocs plugins.
You should get some output that looks like this:

```console
INFO     -  Documentation built in 27.56 seconds
INFO     -  [21:52:17] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'
INFO     -  [21:52:17] Serving on http://0.0.0.0:8000/
```

Visit <http://0.0.0.0:8000/> in your web browser to view the site.
Pages will automatically refresh when you save changes in your editor.

### Python

If you have a recent version of Python installed, then local installation should be as simple as:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installed, you can view the site by running:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

The log output will show a URL, probably <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> - open this in your browser to view the site.
Pages will automatically refresh when you save changes in your editor.

### Social cards

If you're having trouble with the social sharing card images, set the environment variable `CARDS` to `false`:

```bash
CARDS=false mkdocs serve
```

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -e 'CARDS=false' -v ${PWD}:/docs ghcr.io/nextflow-io/training-mkdocs:latest
```

## Announcement banner

If there is an announcement banner, you can enable and customise it using the following config in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
extra:
  # Announcement banner for upcoming training
  announcement:
    active: false
    date_text: March 5-6, 2024
    register_url: https://nf-co.re/events/2024/training-foundational-march
```

If you need more customisation, edit `docs/assets/overrides/main.html`

## Figures & diagrams

Graphics should be drawn using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).
Please use the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) and give files a `.excalidraw.svg` filename suffix.
Files will continue to be editable by others using this method.

Excalidraw SVGs should be embedded as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<figure class="excalidraw">
--8<-- "docs/basic_training/img/channel-files.excalidraw.svg"
</figure>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> Note: The file path is from the root of the repo, not the markdown file!

We inline the SVG into the content like this to make remotely loaded fonts work, as well as dark-mode compatibility.

## Content style and formatting

All training content must be written as markdown.

### Formatting / linting

Please make sure that you have Prettier installed and working locally: <https://prettier.io/> (ideally via the VSCode plugin or similar, formatting on save).

There is a GitHub action that checks pull-requests for valid formatting.

### Admonitions

We use admonitions extensively to make certain pieces of content stand out.
Please see the [official docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/) for an explanation.

- Note that we have two custom admonitions: `exercise` and `result` (alias `solution`).
- `!!!` does a regular admonition, `???` makes it collapsed (click to expand).
- Intendation is important! Make sure you check the rendered site, as it's easy to make a mistake.

## Known limitations

There are a couple of known limitations that I haven't figured out how to get around yet

### Code annotations

Mkdocs Material uses `// code comments` to anchor the annotations. That's great, until you want an annotation in the middle of a large multi-line string (say, like a `script` block).

There will hopefully be a way to add annotations at arbitrary line numbers in the future.
See the footnote on the mkdocs material docs:

> Code annotations [are] currently not compatible with [..] languages that do not have comments in their grammar. However, we're actively working on supporting alternate ways of defining code annotations, allowing to always place code annotations at the end of lines.

See [this GitHub discussions thread](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/3832#discussioncomment-4871068) for updates.

Note also that annotations cannot be added to script blocks generated by importing an external file.

### Word highlighting

Code blocks can have lines highlighted with `hl_lines` in the code block header. However, specific words / characters can not have additional focus (as in a GitHub diff, for example).

## TODO / FIXME

Please use `TODO` comments when you see something that needs coming back to.
I recommend the [Todo Tree VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) to find these comments easily.
