= Operators 

Operators are methods that allow you to connect channels to each other or to transform values emitted by a channel applying some user provided rules.

There are seven main groups that are detailed in the documentation that cover:

== Basic example

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
nums = Channel.from(1,2,3,4)         
square = nums.map { it -> it * it }  // <2>
square.view()                        // <3>
----

<1> Create a queue channel emitting four values.
<2> Create a new channel, transforming each number to its square.
<3> Print the channel content.

Operators can be chained to implement custom behaviors:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel.from(1,2,3,4)
        .map { it -> it * it }
        .view()
----

== Basic operators

Here we go over some of the most commonly used operators.

=== view

The `view` operator prints the items emitted by a channel to the console standard output, appending a
_new line_ character to each of them. For example:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
      .from('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
      .view()
----

It prints:

```
foo
bar
baz
```

An optional _closure_ parameter can be specified to customize how items are printed. For example:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
      .from('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
      .view { "- $it" }
----

It prints:

----
- foo
- bar
- baz
----

=== map

The `map` operator applies a function of your choosing to every item emitted by a channel, and returns the items so obtained as a new channel. The function applied is called the _mapping_ function and is expressed with a _closure_ as shown in the example below:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
    .from( 'hello', 'world' )
    .map { it -> it.reverse() }
    .view()
----

A `map` can associate to each element a generic _tuple_ containing any data as needed.

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
    .from( 'hello', 'world' )
    .map { word -> [word, word.size()] }
    .view { word, len -> "$word contains $len letters" }
----

[discrete]
=== Exercise

Use `fromPath` to create a channel emitting the _fastq_ files matching the pattern `data/ggal/*.fq`,
then chain with a map to return a pair containing the file name and the path itself.
Finally print the resulting channel.

.Answer:
[%collapsible]
====
[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel.fromPath('data/ggal/*.fq')
        .map { file -> [ file.name, file ] }
        .view { name, file -> "> file: $name" }
----
====

=== into

The `into` operator connects a source channel to two or more target channels in such a way the values emitted by the source channel are copied to the target channels. For example:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
     .from( 'a', 'b', 'c' )
     .into{ foo; bar }

foo.view{ "Foo emits: " + it }
bar.view{ "Bar emits: " + it }
----

TIP: Note the use in this example of curly brackets and the `;` as channel names separator. This is needed because the actual parameter of into is a _closure_ which defines the target channels to which the source one is connected.


=== mix

The `mix` operator combines the items emitted by two (or more) channels into a single channel.

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
c1 = Channel.from( 1,2,3 )
c2 = Channel.from( 'a','b' )
c3 = Channel.from( 'z' )

c1 .mix(c2,c3).view()
----

```
1
2
a
3
b
z
```

IMPORTANT: The items in the resulting channel have the same order as in respective original channel,
however there's no guarantee that the element of the second channel are append after the elements
of the first. Indeed in the above example the element `a` has been printed before `3`.

=== flatten

The `flatten` operator transforms a channel in such a way that every _tuple_ is flattened so that each single entry is emitted as a sole element by the resulting channel.

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
foo = [1,2,3]
bar = [4,5,6]

Channel
    .from(foo, bar)
    .flatten()
    .view()
----

The above snippet prints:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

=== collect

The `collect` operator collects all the items emitted by a channel to a list and returns the resulting object as a sole emission.

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
    .from( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
    .collect()
    .view()
----

It prints a single value:

```
[1,2,3,4]
```

TIP: The result of the `collect` operator is a *value* channel.


=== groupTuple

The `groupTuple` operator collects tuples (or lists) of values emitted by the source channel, grouping together the elements that share the same key. Finally it emits a new tuple object for each distinct key collected.

Try the following example:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
     .from( [1,'A'], [1,'B'], [2,'C'], [3, 'B'], [1,'C'], [2, 'A'], [3, 'D'] )
     .groupTuple()
     .view()
----

It shows:

```
[1, [A, B, C]]
[2, [C, A]]
[3, [B, D]]
```

This operator is useful to process together all elements for which there is a common
property or a grouping key.

[discrete]
=== Exercise

Use `fromPath` to create a channel emitting the _fastq_ files matching the pattern `data/ggal/*.fq`,
then use a `map` to associate to each file the name prefix. Finally group together all
files having the same common prefix.


=== join

The `join` operator creates a channel that joins together the items emitted by two channels for which exists a matching key. The key is defined, by default, as the first element in each item emitted.

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
left = Channel.from(['X', 1], ['Y', 2], ['Z', 3], ['P', 7])
right= Channel.from(['Z', 6], ['Y', 5], ['X', 4])
left.join(right).view()
----

The resulting channel emits:

```
[Z, 3, 6]
[Y, 2, 5]
[X, 1, 4]
```

TIP: Notice 'P' is missing in the final result

=== branch

The `branch` operator allows you to forward the items emitted by a source channel to one or more output channels, choosing one of them at a time.

The selection criteria is defined by specifying a closure that provides one or more boolean expressions, each of which is identified by a unique label. On the first expression that evaluates to a true value, the current item is bound to a named channel as the label identifier.
For example:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
    .from(1,2,3,40,50)
    .branch {
        small: it < 10
        large: it > 10
    }
    .set { result }

 result.small.view { "$it is small" }
 result.large.view { "$it is large" }
----

NOTE: The `branch` operator returns a multi-channel object i.e. a variable that holds 
more than one channel object.
